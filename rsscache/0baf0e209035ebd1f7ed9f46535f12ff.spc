<p>Announcing the sanction, May <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/10/tories-urgently-investigating-after-mp-uses-n-word-at-public-event">said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was shocked to hear of these remarks, which are completely unacceptable. I immediately asked the chief whip to suspend the party whip. Language like this has absolutely no place in politics or in today’s society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Morris described the idea of the UK leaving the EU without a deal as a “real n***er in the woodpile” when discussing the impact of Brexit on the financial services industry at an event at London’s East India Club, organised by the Politeia think tank. A recording of the event was subsequently published by the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/anne-marie-morris-racist_uk_5963b0cae4b03f144e2c7c78?utm_hp_ref=uk">Huffington Post</a>.</p>

<p>In a subsequent apology, the MP for Newton Abbot said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The comment was totally unintentional. I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting aside the curious question of how exactly the comment could have been “unintentional”, the case serves as a reminder of the rules on disciplining MPs.</p>

<p>As abhorrent as the phrase is, public use of racist language is insufficient legal grounds for the expulsion of an MP from parliament. According to the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/2">Representation of the People Act</a>, an MP will only be disqualified from sitting if they are “found guilty of one or more offences … and sentenced or ordered to be imprisoned or detained indefinitely or for more than one year”. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/a-z_of_parliament/e-g/82139.stm">Peter Baker</a> was the last MP to be so expelled from the House of Commons in 1954 after receiving a seven-year prison sentence for forgery.</p>

<h2>Past cases</h2>

<p>Given therefore that there is no way to dismiss Morris in these circumstances, there have been calls for her to resign instead. Should Morris have been an employee and used this phrase in a workplace meeting, it’s highly likely that her behaviour would have constituted a sufficient reason for dismissal.</p>

<p>For a dismissal to be <a href="http://www.lawonline.ie/law-guides/business/discipline-and-dismissal/">fair</a>, it has to be for a “potentially fair reason” such as capability, conduct, redundancy, breach of statute or “some other substantial reason”. The use of racist language would obviously fall into the category of misconduct, and as such constitute a sufficient reason to dismiss.</p>

<p>In 2016 the <a href="http://www.xperthr.co.uk/law-reports/fair-dismissal-for-use-of-racist-term-heard-by-white-colleagues-only/159909/">Employment Tribunal</a> dismissed an ambulance care assistant’s claim of unfair dismissal after he was fired for his use of a racially offensive word in a workplace conversation. In this case, the employee defended himself by saying he was using “local street talk” and claimed that in using the n-word, he had not intended to be racist or derogatory.</p>

<p>But the tribunal found it was irrelevant that he hadn’t meant to offend anyone – nor was it relevant that he hadn’t realised anyone else was listening. The fact that the comment was made to white people only also made no difference in this case.</p>

<p>A Sussex police officer was similarly dismissed last year for his use of the same word. A disciplinary panel concluded that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We will not accept the use of such words used by any staff or officers and there is no place for any such word in a modern police service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In light of these cases, it seems very unlikely that Morris’ position as an independent MP for Newton Abbot will be sustainable. Her offence is all the more egregious due to her public, representative role, along with the fact that an apology was apparently only made after she was criticised.</p>

<p>Conservative peer <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/2273176/David-Cameron-urged-to-sack-Tory-peer-after-nigger-in-the-woodpile-remark.html">Robert Dixon-Smith</a> escaped sanction for his use of the same phrase in the House of Lords in 2008, his excuse being that, “I left my brains behind”.</p>

<p>That was nine years ago. In suspending the whip so quickly from Morris, the Conservative party appears to be treating the use of racist language more seriously than it did back then. It’s hard to imagine the whip will ever be restored to Morris or that the party would allow her to re-stand in any future election under the Tory banner.</p>

<p>But given that the law protects Morris from being dismissed, the question remains, therefore, whether she will take the ultimate responsibility for her actions, and effectively dismiss herself.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80828/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

Whatever their political leanings, Westerners can find something interesting to read about China’s treatment of its ethnic minorities, whether on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/16/tibet-monks-selfimmolation-china">plight of the Tibetans</a> or rising tensions between the Chinese state and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-39460538">Uighurs of Xinjiang</a>. China is increasingly being talked about as part of the global “war” against <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/01/the-islamic-state-pledged-to-attack-china-next-heres-why/">Islamist extremism</a>, or as an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/culture/story/20131215-how-china-portrays-its-minorities">anti-multicultural regime</a> that mistreats its ethnic minorities. </p>

<p>Faced with this criticism and pressure, the Chinese government generally claims to be developing and bringing economic prosperity to its supposedly “backward” regions, which have large ethnic minority populations. Since the 2000s, Beijing has been pushing a grand national strategy known as the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/public/Research/Asia/1009pp_chinasgrowth.pdf">Western Development Programme</a>. Its primary stated aim is to integrate peripheral regions with the rest of the country, using infrastructure development to help facilitate better movement of goods and people between China’s less developed western regions and its more developed and densely populated eastern “core”.</p>

<p>But while it’s ostensibly focused on creating a more equal development model, this programme is also a nation-building mission. While it aims both to better integrate groups outside the <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21710264-worlds-rising-superpower-has-particular-vision-ethnicity-and-nationhood-has">ethnic Han majority</a> into China’s mainstream politics, economy and culture, it also aims to encourage more Han Chinese to migrate to areas heavily populated by ethnic minorities. So some 16 years after it was introduced, how has the programme played out, and how has it affected China’s ethnic question?</p>

<h2>As seen from above</h2>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16305745">recent paper</a>, Christopher Paik and I tackled these questions by looking at Chinese census data from 2000 and 2010 alongside night-time satellite images of streetlight illumination. Because the Chinese state enjoys a monopoly on electricity provision, the electric light visible at night is a good indicator of how much development different areas have seen.</p>

<p>By comparing provinces’ demographic changes with the change in their luminosity at night over ten years, we were able to establish that in Western China, the ethnic dimension of development is most salient in the five so-called <a href="http://chinadictionary.net/five-autonomous-regions-of-china/">autonomous regions</a>, areas host to many of China’s 100m-plus ethnic minority people (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131108022004/http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/newsandcomingevents/t20110428_402722244.htm">about 8.5%</a> of China’s population).</p>

<p>In these areas – Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi and Ningxia – what seems to matter most is how integrated a particular ethnic minority area is with the rest of China. If the Chinese central government considers an area better integrated, the minority populations who live there experience more development; in areas less integrated with the rest of China, the central government is more likely to channel development efforts towards the west’s Han Chinese populations in hopes of connecting them more closely with the rest of the country.</p>

<hr>

<iframe src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/n8DrD/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen" msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen" width="100%" height="418"></iframe>

<hr>

<p>So whereas increases in ethnic minority concentration are generally associated with increases in development in the western provinces, this relationship does not hold in the autonomous provinces, which have benefited less from the Western Development Programme. Still predominantly inhabited by ethnic minorities, they remain less integrated with the rest of China than other western areas.</p>



<p>We also found that the overall relationship between development and the concentration of minorities isn’t consistent among the different autonomous provinces. In Tibet, the correlation is negative: counties whose Tibetan population is outpacing the Han population have experienced less development. But the opposite is true in Inner Mongolia, where counties whose ethnic Mongol population is growing have benefited from more economic development, not less.</p>

<p>Why the inconsistency? One explanation is that <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/china/21722853-chinese-mongolians-are-still-asserting-their-identity-inner-mongolia-has-become-chinas-model">Inner Mongolia</a> was China’s first official ethnic minority region, established in 1947; thanks to a steady influx of Han Chinese, ethnic Mongolians now make up less than than 20% of its population. The Chinese government considers the region much better integrated than Tibet, which was only established as an autonomous region in 1965, and where Han Chinese still make up less than 10% of the population. </p>

<p>What this all suggests is that in an authoritarian system such as China, economic development is deeply shot through with the imperative to exert political control. The Chinese government doesn’t treat all its ethnic minority groups in the same way: the more “loyal” a group is to the Chinese state and the more integrated it is into the culture and economy, the better its members will be treated. This does not bode well for the rebellious Tibetans or Uighurs, who continue to challenge the Chinese government’s plans for their homelands.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/79468/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>Despite arguments that a unilateral offer to protect the rights of EU citizens would constitute both a gesture of goodwill and a politically astute move, on June 26 the UK government elected to make an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-the-position-of-eu-citizens-in-the-uk-and-uk-nationals-in-the-eu">offer</a> conditional on reciprocity. The details of what this means for EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit are vague. The position for UK nationals living in the rest of the EU is even more so.</p>

<p>The UK government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-the-position-of-eu-citizens-in-the-uk-and-uk-nationals-in-the-eu">policy paper</a> on the issue largely focuses on what is on offer for EU citizens in the UK. <a href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2017/07/all-of-life-is-changed-impact-of-brexit.html">Our conclusions</a> on how this translates to UK nationals elsewhere in the EU are derived from what reciprocating the UK’s offer would mean.</p>

<h2>What the UK is offering</h2>

<p>On a handful of issues, the UK’s proposal provides some detail as to what UK nationals living in the other 27 EU member states (EU-27) can expect. For example, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/27/fewer-britons-in-rest-of-europe-than-previously-thought-ons-research">21% who are over 65-years-old</a> will be relieved to learn that it has committed to continuing to “export and uprate the UK state pension within the EU”. This implies that their pensions will not be frozen, but will be increased in line with pension increases in the UK. </p>

<p>It also intends to maintain its position on child benefit, meaning UK citizens will still be able to claim the child benefits to which they are entitled when they live abroad. For those UK citizens undertaking education in another EU country, their right to remain in the country will apply until course completion. Those with residence rights will also have the same access to tuition fees and any maintenance grants as the host country’s nationals.</p>

<p>Healthcare poses greater complexities. The UK proposes a new arrangement “akin to the EHIC [European Health Insurance Card] scheme”, which <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/EHIC/Pages/about-the-ehic.aspx">entitles</a> those covered by their home NHS to medical treatment in another EU country. But given that all EU and non-EU states currently party to the EHIC scheme also have some form of free movement agreement, this suggestion must be in the category of having your cake and eating it.</p>

<p>The UK’s proposal does not, however, address numerous other issues, including equal access to housing, equal tax benefits, and whether UK citizens will be allowed to reside in an EU-27 country after Brexit.</p>

<h2>What the logic of reciprocity means</h2>

<p>The UK’s proposal rejects the “acquired rights” approach of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/essential-principles-citizens-rights_en_0.pdf">the EU stance</a>. Instead, the UK government ultimately seeks to align the status and processing of EU nationals with its national immigration law. This will follow a cut-off date and grace period (as yet unspecified) after which EU citizens living in the UK will be subject to the same rules as non-EU citizens. </p>

<p>Disputes would be settled through national courts without any protection from a supranational authority, such as the EU’s Court of Justice. It would be significantly more difficult for EU citizens to enforce their residence and other rights than at present. </p>

<p>If the EU-27 were to reciprocate the offer, UK citizens in the EU-27 would also become subject to their host country’s immigration laws. This means they will have what’s called “third country national” (TCN) status. This carries rights in EU law. </p>

<p>The EU’s <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32003L0109&amp;from=en">Long-Term Residence (LTR) Directive</a> provides legal protection to some TCNs and governs the scheme by which they can acquire long-term residence status. Under the directive, this status must be granted where certain conditions are met. </p>

<p>Of course, national authorities retain some discretion and some residence matters, such as healthcare entitlements, may be devolved to regional or local level. TCNs with long-term residence status must in many respects be treated equally to nationals by their host country. For example, they have equal access to employment, self-employment, recognition of their qualifications, tax benefits and pensions. </p>

<p>Long-term residency has been described as a “<a href="http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/the-longterm-residence-status-as-a-subsidiary-form-of-eu-citizenship(4905f8ac-a068-4bbd-913b-60e862495fb5)/export.html">subsidiary form of EU citizenship</a>”, but it does not have all the perks of the full version. States can confine social assistance for long-term residents to core benefits, such as care for pregnant women, and can restrict some access to employment. </p>

<h2>Comparisons with the EU proposal</h2>

<p>The EU proposal is a better offer for UK citizens resident in the EU-27 than long-term residence status would be. That is not a surprise – the EU wants to protect its 3.2m citizens in the UK, and offers something more than TCN status to the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/whatinformationisthereonbritishmigrantslivingineurope/jan2017">1.2m</a> UK citizens in the rest of the EU. The EU proposal includes additional protections exclusive to EU citizens, such as social security coordination rules and supplementary rights for the free movement of workers.</p>

<p>Under either the EU proposal or as long-term residents, UK nationals in the EU-27 come out relatively unscathed. Nevertheless, while the gap between these two options is noticeable, it is far from the <a href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2017/07/all-of-life-is-changed-impact-of-brexit.html">chasm</a> between EU citizens’ current position in the UK and the UK’s proposals for their post-Brexit future. </p>

<p>If the polls are to be believed and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/01/poll-european-eu-rights-brexit">60%</a> of UK nationals want to keep their EU citizenship, the UK government has a greater stake in this than its comparably lukewarm proposals suggest. And the stake is greater still if the cost is “crashing out” of the EU without a withdrawal agreement at all.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80562/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

Abadi was there to congratulate security forces for the victory. </p>

<p>Iraqis have been waiting for this moment for three years, since IS <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/10/iraq-sunni-insurgents-islamic-militants-seize-control-mosul">captured</a> the country’s second city and other key areas in 2014. </p>

<p>Since the announcement of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/world/middleeast/iraq-recaptures-al-nuri-mosque-in-mosul-from-isis-but-only-rubble-remains.html">recapture</a> of Mosul’s iconic al-Nuri mosque, <a href="https://theconversation.com/after-years-of-destruction-iraqis-are-rescuing-their-cultural-identity-80019">destroyed</a> by IS in late June, social media has been buzzing with hashatags <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D8%B3%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%AA_%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A9">such as #سقطت<em>دولة</em> الخراف</a>ة  (the state of myth has fallen), <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B5%D9%84_%D8%AA%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%B1">#الموصل_تتحرر</a> (Mosul is being liberated), and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%AF_%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85">#غرد_للسلام</a> (tweet for peace). </p>

<p>The general <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17s0qiYRysw">reaction</a> in Iraq and on social media to the recapture of Mosul has been one of joy and celebration, yet for many, the feelings are mixed. Although it is a huge blow for IS, the victory does not mean that IS has been defeated across Iraq. Battles are still awaiting in Tel Afar in the north-west, to Hawija and other areas in Anbar Province in western Iraq. And even when these are retaken, IS will <a href="https://theconversation.com/even-if-raqqa-and-mosul-fall-islamic-state-is-far-from-finished-79370">continue</a> its regional and global insurgency. </p>

<p>IS’s territorial caliphate is falling, but its ideology – which argues that its members follow the “true Islam”, fighting heretics and unbelievers – is not.</p>

<p>For Iraqis, smiles are mixed with tears, and optimism mixed with fears. Many thousands of lives have been lost and too much blood shed in the battle against IS. Many more thousands have been displaced and the destruction has been widespread. Iraqis rightfully ask whether all of this could have been avoided and whether those responsible will ever be held accountable. They are aware of the massive challenges ahead, politically, economically, and socially. These include the <a href="https://www.clingendael.nl/sites/default/files/Report%20Iraq%20at%20War%20%28Again%29%20-%20March%202016.pdf">conflicting interests</a> of the forces fighting on the ground, as well as those of countries such as Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the US, whose interventions are often seen as destabilising to the Iraqi state. </p>



<h2>Confronting Daeshism</h2>

<p>Daeshism (<em>Daeshia</em> or <em>Daeshna</em> in Arabic) is derived from Daesh – the Arabic acronym for IS – but Iraqis use it to refer to a general act of subjugating outsiders. It is the attempted suppression of beliefs, ideas, behaviour, and appearances on religious grounds – and it is not just IS doing this in Iraq. </p>

<p>Like IS, Daeshim uses an internal narrative of “us versus them”, going beyond sectarian differences to threaten individual liberties viewed as unacceptable by some religious leaders. The recent kidnap, torture, and murder of young artist <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraq-male-model-karar-nushi-killed-murder-torture-baghdad-good-looks-gay-palestine-street-a7824586.html">Karar Nushi</a> by unknown armed groups in Baghdad, merely because of his appearance, is just the latest in a series of heinous crimes that are an unprecedented threat to civil liberties in Iraq. </p>

<p>These wider repressions are nurtured by radical religious arguments, whether Shia or Sunni, which target art, music, singing, and dance, as <em>haram</em> – things that must be banned. Leaders of Islamic parties are deliberately distorting concepts such as secularism and civil society, tarnishing them as atheism that must be tackled. For example, a radical religious stance <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/en/originals/2015/01/iraq-state-education-religious-curricula.html">has made its way</a> to educational institutions, both in theory and in practice, and to some Iraqi school textbooks.</p>

<p>Daeshism reflects the mindset of sections of Iraqi society and of Arabic Islamic societies in general. Although they may denounce IS’s practices as acts of terrorism, they still oppose and oppress people or actions that do not fit their religious rules. The dilemma for Islamic societies lies in this contradiction. As the Iraqi analyst, Nibras Kazimi, <a href="https://talisman-gate.com/2017/07/07/arriving-at-singularity/">summarises</a>: “Middle Easterners need to fundamentally re-engineer their societies, economies and cultures.” Small steps have been taken on this path by some intellectuals, activists, and religious reformists, but these remain scarce and unconnected.</p>

<h2>Militias and corruption</h2>

<p>Militias and tribes have been empowered across the country after a security vacuum was created following the IS’s capture of Mosul in June 2014. In many areas of Baghdad and the south of Iraq, in particular, their power and influence exceed the already-vulnerable authority of the state. Gang crimes, including kidnappings, theft, murder, and rape, have been <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/01/kidnap-abduction-crime-militias-baghdad.html">on the rise</a> in the capital and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraq-crime-soars-in-basra-as-army-leaves-to-fight-isis-a6804506.html">southern provinces</a>. In most cases, the perpetrators are unknown and unaccountable.</p>

<p>Corruption is often equated by Iraqis with IS, and corrupt leaders with terrorism. In a new <a href="https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/Iraq%20April%202017%20Survey%20Public%20Final%20%281%29%20%281%29.pdf">survey</a> published in June by the National Democratic Institute across Iraq, participants said they viewed corruption as the main underlying cause that gave rise to IS. Corruption has weakened Iraq’s governance and security, and eaten away at its institutions. If it is not substantially addressed, IS, the threats of militias and tribes, and wider Daeshism will linger.</p>

<p>The solution starts with the Iraqi society, not its governments. Iraqis cannot wait for top-down salvation. They need to undertake a collective effort to combat corruption, with 2018 parliamentary elections as an opportunity towards this goal. The liberation of Iraqi lands from IS, with the sacrifices that it has required, must not be squandered.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80758/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

Barbarities are an everyday occurrence.</p>

<p>There are rules governing the conduct of warring parties. The 1949 Geneva Conventions form the core of international humanitarian law. Violating these rules is a <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule156">war crime</a>. Some atrocities go even beyond this level of criminality. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/16/un-condemns-isis-genocide-against-yazidis-in-iraq-and-syria">Genocide</a>, for instance, is <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CrimeOfGenocide.aspx">an international crime in itself</a>, while the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/5415/2017/en/">systematic killing of political opposition</a> would constitute a <a href="http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/crimes-against-humanity.html">crime against humanity</a>.</p>

<p>The existence of these offences counts for little, of course, unless the law is enforced. This raises the question: is there any way of prosecuting any side of the Syrian conflict? These are some options that could help inform the way forward. </p>

<h2>1. International Criminal Court investigation</h2>

<p>The International Criminal Court (<a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">ICC</a>), based in the Hague, is designed to prosecute “the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole”. So perhaps it could act in Syria.</p>

<p>The court operates on a consensual basis, so that (perhaps counterintuitively) states must sign up to it to allow the exercise of ICC jurisdiction. Syria is not a party to the court.</p>

<p>There is a workaround though. The ICC can investigate international crimes in any country if the UN Security Council requests it to do so. This happened to <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2005/sc8351.doc.htm">Sudan</a> in 2005 and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/02/27/un-security-council-refers-libya-icc">Libya</a> in 2011. Despite <a href="http://www.news.admin.ch/NSBSubscriber/message/attachments/29293.pdf">best efforts</a> by lobbying states, the same has not happened in the case of Syria. Both <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47860#.WQr0ak11odV">Russia and China blocked</a> a proposed referral in 2014 and there is little sign of them changing their minds. </p>

<h2>2. A bespoke tribunal</h2>

<p>The creation of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> by the UN Security Council in 1993 marked a watershed moment in the administration of international criminal justice. A statute was drafted and experienced judges and lawyers recruited to help build a system of accountability. The subsequent creation of a <a href="http://unictr.unmict.org/">similar institution</a> to deal with the 1994 Rwanda genocide continued the trend.</p>

<p>Such one-off approaches have since fallen out of use, however, in favour of ICC prosecution. And, crucially, a UN Security Council resolution is required to create such an international institution (historically, at least). This makes the “bespoke tribunal” option about as likely as an ICC investigation.</p>

<h2>3. A ‘hybrid’ court</h2>

<p>“Hybrid” courts run on a mix of national and international law and are staffed by both local and international lawyers, allowing for a degree of local ownership. Examples include the <a href="http://www.rscsl.org/">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> and <a href="https://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a>.  Proposals for a similar Syrian model <a href="http://www.publicinternationallawandpolicygroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Chautauqua-Blueprint-2014.pdf">already exist</a>.</p>

<p>Such courts are, however, generally created with the consent of the state concerned. If the Bashar al-Assad regime is to remain in power in Syria this may create <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/10928/mixed-chamber-syria-idea-time-come/">significant difficulties</a> for this approach. Its success would depend on the government’s willingness to cooperate and submit itself to investigation alongside opposition groups.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/10968/alternative-jurisdictional-bases-hybrid-tribunal-syria/">A more viable alternative</a> may be to establish a “hybrid” court in a neighbouring country such as Jordan or Turkey, though this option would similarly require cooperation from the Syrian authorities (whoever that may be) to succeed.</p>

<h2>4. Universal jurisdiction</h2>

<p>Trials of atrocities committed in Syria are, in fact, already underway.  In <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-31639378">Sweden</a>, <a href="http://www.rferl.org/a/second-iraqi-migrant-found-guilty-war-crimes-finland/27630118.html">Finland</a>, <a href="http://www.justiceinfo.net/en/component/k2/27104-refugees-spur-german-justice-to-tackle-syrian-war-crimes.html">Germany</a> and <a href="http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/schweizer-justiz-ermittelt-wegen-kriegsverbrechen-in-syrien/story/21007826">Switzerland</a> refugees suspected of international crimes are being prosecuted under the doctrine of “universal jurisdiction”. This principle allows any state to prosecute any perpetrator of a serious international crime. Precedent for such action includes the recently concluded <a href="https://www.hrw.org/tag/hissene-habre">trial of the former Chadian president Hissène Habré</a> under Senegalese jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Trials brought under this principle do present their own difficulties (such as evidence acquisition) and are limited in their reach.  Nevertheless this form of legal scrutiny, even at a limited level, serves as a warning to warring parties that criminal actions do have consequences.</p>

<h2>5. Trials in Syrian courts</h2>

<p>Prosecution of atrocities in the Syrian courts would present considerable logistical and financial difficulties for a ruined state. Even if national trials were feasible (if funded externally, for instance) they would risk being politically vulnerable to manipulation by the ruling elite, whoever that may be.</p>

<p>Alternatively there is the choice of avoiding justice altogether, perhaps via an act of amnesty. The present scale of inhumanity in Syria makes this a deeply troubling option.</p>

<h2>No easy solution</h2>

<p>As the Syria conflict shows little sign of abating, the priority at present should be on the cessation of hostilities. But, as part of the reconciliation process that follows, transitional justice should play a key role. The favourite option may be the creation a “hybrid” court (politics permitting), paired with ongoing “universal jurisdiction” trials in states able to carry these out.</p>

<p>For the time being agencies such as the UN-created <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/35795/syria-general-assembly-sidesteps-security-council/">“investigatory mechanism”</a> and the non-profit <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/assad-war-crimes-cija_us_571ed6e6e4b0f309baee63e0">Commission for International Justice and Accountability</a> must continue to collect and catalogue the evidence required for the time when it is so critically needed.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/75908/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

For those directly affected by his brutal and lawless “war on drugs”, which has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-duterte-drugs-idUSKBN19G05D">claimed the lives of thousands of people</a>, the only hope is for an end to the suffering. But in the absence of a clear international declaration against Duterte’s disastrous regime, that hope is in vain. </p>

<p>The sad fact is that much of the suffering Duterte is inflicting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/10/donald-trump-rodrigo-duterte-philippines">was entirely predictable</a>. The Philippines’ human rights institutions are fragile, and Duterte came to office with a well-known record as a mayor who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-death-squad.html?_r=0">sanctioned death squads</a> to dole out vigilante justice in his city. But the international community <a href="https://theconversation.com/dutertes-obama-insult-was-shameful-but-the-west-has-turned-a-blind-eye-to-much-much-worse-64037">failed</a> to respond to his election with due alarm, and it is still failing to realise the sheer destruction the Duterte administration is causing. How bad will it need to get before other nations back away from him?</p>

<p>Nominally aimed at tackling a <a href="https://theconversation.com/just-how-big-is-the-drug-problem-in-the-philippines-anyway-66640">much-hyped but poorly understood</a> methamphetamine “crisis”, the scores of extra-judicial killings have resulted in little capture of the networked organised crime Duterte says is behind the “drug menace”. Instead people are gunned down in the middle of the street by vigilantes or by an increasingly brazen police force, whether <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/29/philippines-disband-police-anti-drugs-units-war-rodrigo-duterte-south-korea">during arrest or in custody</a>. Their corpses are left in the street, sometimes with a cardboard sign saying “drug user” or “pusher”. </p>

<p>This is a matter of social cleansing, with many of the victims among the poorest people in Filipino society. And yet many nations refuse to sign a UN declaration condemning the policy.</p>

<p>During the second half of 2016, Duterte <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/duterte-anti-us-philippines-isolationist-foreign-policy-insult-barack-obama-china">exploited</a> his country’s rising importance to the US by <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-history-behind-philippine-president-dutertes-obama-insult-65075">coarsely insulting Barack Obama</a> with impunity. But Trump <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2017/03/straight-from-the-us-state-department-the-pivot-to-asia-is-over/">couldn’t care less</a> about Obama’s “pivot to Asia”, and Duterte has duly pivoted to public words of admiration. Trump returned the favour by <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-praised-rodrigo-duterte-for-unbelievable-job-on-the-drug-problem-in-philippines/">praising Duterte</a> for his “unbelievable job on the drug problem”. </p>



<p>So far, Western powers have failed to show much care for the Philippines’ dire human rights situation. While <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/158643/eu-presses-duterte-govt-human-rights-issues-war-vs-drugs">the EU</a> has perhaps been the most consistent and high-profile Duterte critic, one of its members has been particularly unhelpful. Britain’s <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-liam-fox-trade-visit-philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte-human-rights-nhs-nurses-a7667711.html">grovelling post-Brexit vote trade visit</a> signalled it is perfectly ready to deviate from the EU’s collective stance against human rights abuses once it quits the bloc. </p>

<p>As if that wasn’t bad enough, the UN high commissioner for human rights had to admonish Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, for <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/theresa-may-human-rights-gift-dictators-un-chief-statement-latest-a7809556.html">comments about</a> human rights getting “in the way” of the fight against terrorism. It was a “gift to despots” said the commissioner. It is a gift to Duterte, and it only makes the situation worse for Filipinos, who are forced to bear the brunt of his violent rule.</p>

<h2>Rebranding the threat</h2>

<p>It doesn’t have to be this way. Duterte is vulnerable and sensitive to foreign criticism, and has little with which to protect himself other than insults. Yet countries such as <a href="http://www.skynews.com.au/video/program/program_featured/2017/06/29/australia-urged-to-hold-duterte-to-account.html">Australia</a> and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/philippines-marawi-rodrigo-duterte-us-forces-joining-battle-besieged-isis-maute-a7784736.html">the US</a> are providing military assistance to Duterte apparently without applying any serious pressure. </p>

<p>Their help with <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/06/23/1712907/australia-sends-spy-planes-marawi">airborne intelligence</a> and “special forces liaison” is offered on the pretext of fighting a local militant group <a href="https://theconversation.com/panic-about-is-in-the-philippines-masks-a-very-real-war-in-the-country-65196">supposedly linked to IS</a>, now laying siege to the city of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/marawi-siege-isis-linked-militants-dump-bodies-civilians-rampage-philippines-a7760566.html">Marawi</a>. </p>

<p>It’s one thing to overlook Duterte’s war on drugs to help him fight a violent insurgency notionally linked to the so-called Islamic State (IS), but even that flawed alliance has its problems. How can these countries defend their support for a leader who publicly says he is willing to <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/174210-duterte-soldiers-killing-civilian-presence">kill civilians</a> – in direct opposition to international humanitarian law?</p>

<p>Duterte is using IS as a pretext for more abuses, and headlines linking the situation in the southern Philippines to IS with little to no evidence play into his hands. But alas, this tendency has a long history. </p>



<p>The Philippines’ half-century-old Muslim insurgency has repeatedly been spuriously accused of links with global militant Islamist networks, notably al-Qaeda during the US’s own post-9/11 “war on terror”. Now, the same claims are simply being rehashed to fit the narrative of a new global threat.</p>

<p>Those nations with interests and relationships with Duterte deserve to be held to account for their silence and tolerance of his crimes. They also need to wake up to the consequences of their inaction. Both the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/duterte-says-the-international-criminal-court-doesnt-worry-him/2017/06/03/8a8f0c62-44d6-11e7-b08b-1818ab401a7f_story.html?utm_term=.ab854fd32d9b">International Criminal Court</a> and the <a href="http://time.com/4768509/philippines-agnes-callamar-un-duterte-drug-war/">UN’s rapporteur on extra-judicial killings</a> have had Duterte in their sights for much of his first year – if not since his time as mayor. </p>

<p>If Western nations want to uphold the legitimacy of these institutions and the values of universal human rights, they must support them and help put pressure on this calamitous despot.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80442/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>But the EU and the UK have a profoundly different understanding of what reciprocity means. While the EU approaches reciprocity as a moral principle and legal guarantee in its offer, the UK merely uses it as a technique to delay making <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/08/mps-reject-brexit-bill-amendment-to-protect-eu-citizens-in-uk">commitments</a> and with which to make <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dbd24ba4-579e-11e7-9fed-c19e2700005f?mhq5j=e3">threats</a> that its offer is dependent on the EU doing the same. But because the substance and legal guarantees of the two proposals is very different, the impact on people’s lives would be too. </p>

<p>There are good reasons to argue that unilaterally guaranteeing citizens’ rights is not actually the most appropriate solution for Brexit negotiations. During the recent UK election campaign, Labour <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-39703151/labour-to-guarantee-rights-of-eu-citizens-in-uk">offered</a> to unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK. This seems morally the right thing to do as it would avoid making these citizens a <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-protect-4-5m-people-from-becoming-brexit-bargaining-chips-79643">bargaining chip</a> in Brexit negotiations. But at the same time, it would make UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU more exposed to trade-offs between their rights and other points under negotiation.   </p>

<p>Unilateral solutions also fail to recognise the cross-border dimension of the lives of the individuals involved, both EU and British citizens. EU citizenship provides a <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-the-eus-rules-on-free-movement-allow-all-its-citizens-to-do-62186">comprehensive set of rights</a>, such as the recognition of qualifications, healthcare co-ordination between member states and rules to transfer entitlements, such as pension contributions, to another country. Such rules require international solutions and cannot simply be resolved by unilateral action from one party at the negotiating table.  </p>

<p>Even offering British citizenship to all EU citizens in the UK, as former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/europe/eu-policy-agenda/brexit/house/house-magazine/86047/yanis-varoufakis-only-theresa-may-can">suggested</a>, is not an appropriate solution as it would not account for such cross-border issues. <a href="https://theconversation.com/dual-nationality-and-the-hurdles-facing-britons-who-want-to-keep-eu-citizenship-after-brexit-74470">Not all</a> EU countries allow dual citizenship and some people may have to give up their citizenship of origin if they want to take British citizenship. </p>

<h2>The case for reciprocity</h2>

<p>The concept of reciprocity is therefore a more appropriate guide to dealing with the rights of the 3.3m EU citizens in the UK and 1.2m British citizens in the EU after Brexit. </p>

<p>There is a strong moral argument for reciprocity. Both British citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK have built up their lives in a foreign country in the legitimate expectation that EU citizenship would protect them. They were never asked to obtain visas, were never told their stay would be temporary, and (with the exception of national voting rights) were treated in pretty much the same way as nationals. They deserve to be treated equally in the opportunity to retain the life and rights they have legitimately acquired. </p>



<p>The EU has taken reciprocity seriously as a moral starting point. It has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/citizens-rights-essential-principles-draft-position-paper_en.pdf">offered</a> that all the rights of both EU citizens in the UK and the British in the rest of the EU will be protected for life. It wants to ensure this via an international agreement between the UK and EU that sets out in detail citizens’ current rights for life, to be protected by judicial control of the Court of Justice of the EU. </p>

<p>Under such an international agreement, which can be part of the UK’s Article 50 withdrawal agreement from the EU, or be a <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-protect-4-5m-people-from-becoming-brexit-bargaining-chips-79643">separate citizens’ agreement</a>, each set of citizens acts as a safeguard for the rights of the other. Without such an international agreement, these citizens lose each other as safeguards and will be at the whim of national governments, which will undoubtedly undermine the rights on which they have legitimately built up their lives.  </p>

<p>The EU might be willing to compromise by accepting an international court other than the Court of Justice to control the agreement, but legally safeguarding reciprocity at an international level <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/20/european-parliament-will-welcome-britain-back-if-voters-veto-brexit">is a strict condition for the EU</a> in its Brexit negotiating position. As Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament, said on a recent trip to the UK: “For us, the agreement is [to have the same rights] as today [and] yesterday, tomorrow … For us, it is a priority and it is a red line.”</p>

<h2>Moral and legal principle</h2>

<p>In contrast, the UK government’s rhetoric fails to recognise reciprocity as a moral and legal principle. Its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/27/theresa-may-offer-generous-eu-citizens-tories-rights-uk">offer</a> is far less generous than the EU’s. Unlike the EU, the UK does not propose to guarantee the rights of EU citizens for life. It is ambiguous on who can retain them, and it undermines some existing rights, such as the ability for EU citizens to bring a family member to live with them in the UK. </p>

<p>Its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-the-position-of-eu-citizens-in-the-uk-and-uk-nationals-in-the-eu">proposal</a> on citizens’ rights is actually unilateral: it intends to act unilaterally on the residence status of EU citizens by turning them into immigrants under general UK immigration law. This implies that EU citizens living in the UK will lose rights that were specific to them.</p>

<p>If the EU “reciprocates” on this offer, it would mean each of the 27 individual member states would deal with the residence requirements for the British living in their countries. This would leave the British in the rest of the EU at the mercy of 27 different and changing immigration laws on which the UK would no longer have any leverage. </p>

<p>So, instead of accepting reciprocity as a moral principle and legal guarantee, the UK is turning it into a race to the bottom at the expense of both EU citizens in the UK and its own citizens in the EU.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80518/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

The world’s leading forum for international cooperation on world economic growth, international trade and the regulation of financial markets presents a unique opportunity to boost her international profile at home and abroad.</p>

<p>In a German election campaign dominated by <a href="https://theconversation.com/angela-merkels-election-manifesto-attempts-to-rebrand-refugees-80447">domestic issues</a>, the G20 presidency lends a platform for Merkel to remind the domestic audience of her personal competence in foreign affairs. At the same time, it underlines Germany’s growing leadership role in Europe: here is a chance for Merkel to orchestrate a show of EU solidarity in the face of multiple internal crises and unsettling transatlantic relations. In Europe and beyond, polls reveal that residents in most G20 member states trust Angela Merkel more than Donald Trump <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/05/on-world-affairs-most-g20-countries-more-confident-in-merkel-than-trump/">to lead on world affairs</a>.</p>

<p>In truth, Merkel will need all of her <em>sangfroid</em> and mediation skills to prevent an embarrassing flop. She has been careful to manage expectations for the July summit, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/merkel-and-the-g-20-a-risk-filled-summit-a-1156255.html">stressing</a> that there will be “many contentious issues” and “difficult decisions”. Given Trump’s protectionist stance, it will not be easy for the summit to conclude its customary unconditional commitment to <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/g20-in-hamburg-alle-fakten-ueber-den-klub-der-maechtigen-a-1153318.html#sponfakt=14">free trade</a>. His stated intention to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris_en">withdraw</a> from the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris_en">Paris agreement</a> on climate control threatens to torpedo one of Germany’s leading priorities for the summit.</p>

<h2>Damage limitation</h2>

<p>In this context, Merkel has little choice but to focus on damage limitation. At a minimum, she must ensure that the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/g20-in-hamburg-alle-fakten-ueber-den-klub-der-maechtigen-a-1153318.html#sponfakt=14">status quo</a> is maintained and the progress of previous G20 summits is not unravelled. Less contentious agenda items such as pandemic prevention and support for women in developing countries may lend a veneer of consensus, but will not be sufficient in themselves to counter the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/trump-pulls-out-of-climate-deal-western-rift-deepens-a-1150486.html">widening breach</a> between the US and Europe on the weightier issues.</p>

<p>The top priority for Merkel – and the greatest challenge of the summit – is to repair the damage caused by the US proposed withdrawal from the Paris agreement on climate control, at the G7 summit in May. In a rare show of public frustration, Merkel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/28/merkel-says-eu-cannot-completely-rely-on-us-and-britain-any-more-g7-talks">declared</a> shortly afterwards that Europe could no longer completely rely on the UK and US as allies. </p>

<p>Other more subtle signals of displeasure with Trump’s leadership have followed. Merkel’s Christian Democrats’ 2017 election manifesto demotes the US from an “important friend” to Germany’s “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-election-merkel-usa-idUSKBN19O1NS">most important partner</a>” outside Europe.  Trump was greeted at Hamburg airport not by Merkel or by the federal president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, but by the mayor of Hamburg.</p>



<p>However, in a <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/g20-gipfel-im-newsblog-brand-in-porsche-zentrum-polizei-prueft-g20-zusammenhang-a-1155713.html">press conference</a> before the summit, Merkel seemed confident of achieving progress on climate protection. To secure any agreement that avoids consolidating a US-European divide, she needs to tackle Trump himself. No doubt some blunt words were exchanged over the <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/06/politics/trump-merkel-g20/index.html">private dinner</a> between the two prior to the summit. </p>

<p>If Merkel can bring climate control back on track, her international reputation will soar. Figures show very high levels of <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/05/on-world-affairs-most-g20-countries-more-confident-in-merkel-than-trump/">disapproval</a> for Trump’s planned withdrawal from the Paris agreement among the public in G20 states. In Germany itself, 93% expressed disapproval of Trump’s actions.</p>

<h2>Protesters at the gates</h2>

<p>One of the major fears facing the German summit hosts is the threat that its achievements might be <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/merkel-and-the-g-20-a-risk-filled-summit-a-1156255.html">overshadowed by violent protests</a>. A key challenge for Germany, recently dubbed the “<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/angela-merkel-donald-trump-democracy-freedom-of-press-a7556986.html">leader of the free world</a>”, is to find a balance between screening out militant protest without resorting to a heavy-handed smothering of free speech. </p>

<p>The planned “Welcome to hell” anti-globalisation march began in a carnival atmosphere but soon turned ugly. The violence was countered with water cannon and pepper gas and the protest halted by police, but skirmishes continued and there were <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/06/german-police-fire-water-cannon-g20-demonstration/">numerous injuries</a> to both the police and the protesters.  More radical events and groups such as the anti-globalisation <a href="http://www.attac.de/was-ist-attac/">Bündnis Attac</a> had already been <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/g20-gipfel-im-newsblog-brand-in-porsche-zentrum-polizei-prueft-g20-zusammenhang-a-1155713.html">banned</a> in advance of the summit.</p>

<h2>Difficult guests</h2>

<p>It seems that militant gate-crashers are not the only ones intent on conflict at the summit. Merkel needs to manage some very difficult guests. She has made it clear that <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/g20-gipfel-angela-merkel-zu-einem-moeglichen-kompromiss-bei-klimapolitik-a-1156294.html">she does not intend to mediate</a> in the growing differences between Trump and Russian president, Vladimir. Trump chose <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/g20-gipfel-in-hamburg-so-laeuft-der-erste-tag-a-1156210.html">precisely the time slot</a> set aside for the G20 climate protection negotiations for a face-to-face meeting with Putin. The US president has also openly accused Moscow of “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-usa-trump-idUSKBN19R02Q">destabilising activities</a>” in Ukraine, so it’s unlikely that the meeting will get off to a good start.</p>

<p>Merkel might have to settle for an “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/climate/g20-climate-change-paris-accord-trump-merkel-germany.html">overwhelming majority</a>” in support of the Paris agreement, as it seems unlikely that Saudi Arabia will offer support – and Russia, Turkey and Indonesia have sent mixed signals on the issue.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has claimed that Germany is committing “<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/g-20-erdogan-and-merkel-with-plenty-to-discuss-a-1156320.html">political suicide</a>” by banning him from addressing a rally of Turkish nationals while in Hamburg for the summit. Merkel was <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/merkel-and-the-g-20-a-risk-filled-summit-a-1156255.html">due to meet Erdoğan</a> privately ahead of the summit to talk about a range of contentious issues.</p>

<p>All in all, Merkel will need to turn in a stellar performance to emerge from this summit with her international leadership credentials intact – and for the global gathering to carry any meaningful weight at all.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80640/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

Now a new report on “<a href="http://www.citizensuk.org/missing_muslims">Missing Muslims</a>” launched by the <a href="http://www.citizensuk.org/islam_public_life_commission">Citizens Commission on Islam, Participation and Public Life</a> on July 3 has challenged the <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/04/why-do-we-pretend-that-all-muslims-are-sweet-smiley-and-integrated/">allegation</a> that Muslim citizens are disengaged from the mainstream of British life. </p>

<p>It finds that “most Muslims in the UK are British citizens” and that a large majority of them actively identify as British. Muslim citizens have also been found to vote in elections at a higher rate than the general population, according to the report. </p>

<p>Such clear demonstrations of public engagement and belonging are set against a volatile sociopolitical context. A documented rise in <a href="https://theconversation.com/finsbury-park-attack-shows-the-harm-islamophobia-continues-to-inflict-on-muslim-communities-79682">Islamophobia</a>, anti-Muslim prejudice and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/20/anti-muslim-hate-surges-after-manchester-and-london-bridge-attacks">hate crimes</a> make it increasingly challenging for Muslim citizens to feel they are equally valued as citizens. But the report also finds much wanting within Muslim communities when it comes to participation in British public life – with barriers particularly affecting Muslim women.</p>

<p>The Citizens Commission on Islam, Participation and Public Life was established in 2015 by <a href="http://www.citizensuk.org/">Citizens UK</a>, a charitable civil society organisation that represents various churches, mosques, synagogues, schools, trade unions and other voluntary associations across England and Wales. Chaired by Conservative MP <a href="https://www.dominicgrieve.org.uk/">Dominic Grieve</a>, the commission has held a number of <a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/i-lost-count-verbal-attacks-10430210">public hearings</a> and received evidence from both organisations and individuals. </p>

<p>Based on my own <a href="http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781137405333">research</a> on Christian and Muslim women’s experiences of citizenship, I gave evidence to the commission’s hearing in Leicester. My focus was on the stereotyping and discrimination of Muslim women in wider society and on barriers to women’s participation in Muslim faith organisations.</p>



<p>The new report notes that, for Muslim women, “disadvantage in employment is particularly acute” and that Muslim women who wear headscarves are “more likely than men to feel unsafe” due to the verbal and physical abuse they suffer. In explaining Muslim women’s disadvantage in the labour market, the authors highlight discriminatory recruitment and hiring practices among employers.   </p>

<h2>Women’s role in mosques</h2>

<p>The report also observes that Muslim women are missing from the governance structures of Muslim institutions. It says that many mosques “are not welcoming to women’s participation at any serious level”. Within this overall picture of male dominance, there is a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/muslims-in-britain/3F6E4E693BC225A6754D1D048BBDFD6C">growing participation</a> of Muslim women in mosques around the country that have created designated women’s spaces. There is also a <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2016.1216142">desire among many Muslim women</a> to take on mosque leadership, management and teaching roles. </p>

<p>The commission makes a strong recommendation for all Muslim organisations to enable “equal access to leadership opportunities” for women. Whether this would include leadership of religious prayer is unclear, as the report falls short of recommending that women should be able to perform the role of an imam in a mosque. The issue of women leading Muslim prayer is <a href="http://forums.ssrc.org/ndsp/2015/04/29/woman-led-prayer-a-conversation-with-juliane-hammer/">controversial</a> and the commission appears to have simply bypassed the issue. </p>

<p>It also fails to mention the slow but growing emergence of women-led mosques, such as the <a href="https://www.indy100.com/article/meet-one-of-the-woman-imams-preaching-at-londons-feminist-mosque--bybuPRWAfW">Inclusive Mosque Initiative</a> in London and plans by the <a href="https://www.womenledmosque.co.uk/about-muslim-womens-council/">Muslim Women’s Council in Bradford</a> to build a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/worshipping-as-equals-plans-to-build-britains-first-women-led-mosque-a6933021.html">women-led mosque</a>. </p>

<p>The report also ignores that sexual minority groups and individuals (LGBT+) are often excluded from faith institutions. Groups such as <a href="https://imaanlondon.wordpress.com/">IMAAN</a> in London and <a href="http://al-jannah.proboards.com/">Al-Jannah</a> in Scotland should be acknowledged for the support they provide to individuals and their contribution to raising awareness and tolerance. </p>

<h2>A question of justice and equality</h2>

<p>In neglecting such contested issues surrounding gender and sexuality, the report risks homogenising all Muslim communities as deeply traditional and conservative. It also risks minimising the progressive changes that some Muslim women and men are currently engaged in towards developing more inclusive practices within their faith communities. </p>

<p>In attempting to explain why Muslim women experience barriers to participation stemming from their own communities, the report suggests a distinction between “religion” and “culture”. But by blaming this gender inequality on culture, it fails to recognise the importance of men’s interest in maintaining the status quo in order to serve their own privilege and control. The Muslim Women’s Network UK <a href="http://www.mwnuk.co.uk//go_files/resources/169296-PM%20Letter%20(Muslim%20Women%20Empowerment).pdf">has emphasised</a> these patriarchal structures as the main hindrance to women’s participation in faith communities. </p>

<p>This isn’t just a problem that affects Muslim women. Elsewhere in British life women are underrepresented in important political, economic and religious institutions ranging from the UK <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/british-election-results-record-number-women-parliament-623521">parliament</a> to business <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-race-for-boardroom-diversity-is-falling-at-the-first-hurdle-29866">boardrooms</a> and churches. But gender discrimination within these institutions is rarely excused as resulting from “culture” – as it is within Muslim organisations. Instead, such discrimination in wider society is talked about as relating to justice, equality and human rights for women.</p>

<p>Secularism does not guarantee gender equality, but neither does religion necessarily promote gender inequality and we must pay attention to specific contexts. By making <a href="https://theconversation.com/good-muslims-or-good-citizens-how-muslim-women-feel-about-integration-58796">comparisons</a>, such as between Christian and Muslim women, we can establish similarities and differences in experiences and views. Such comparisons are likely to reveal that, as the late MP Jo Cox said, there is <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2016/june/jo-cox-maiden-speech-in-the-house-of-commons/">more that unites us than divides us</a>.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80436/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>El Sistema is a vast operation that brings hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan children, many of them ostensibly poor, under the umbrella of a classical orchestral training scheme in the name of their “salvation”. It has been covered extensively in the past decade, often by journalists who are given red-carpet tours and press office accounts and the success stories of individual musicians. This has all given the programme an unduly rosy international image, further distorted by a romanticised vision of the power of music.</p>

<p>However, recent studies by academics and researchers – <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/el-sistema-9780199341559?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;">myself included</a> – paint a rather different picture. They point to <a href="https://geoffbakermusic.wordpress.com/el-sistema-older-posts/idb-study-sheds-doubt-on-el-sistemas-claims-of-social-inclusion-and-transformation-short-version/">a high dropout rate and low poverty rate among the musicians</a>, limited evidence of social transformation, and various other systemic problems. But with journalists and others around the world now in thrall to El Sistema’s miraculous story, these inconvenient accounts are largely overlooked.</p>

<p>Instead, the Anglophone media in particular tends to stick to an idealised image of El Sistema that it began constructing around the time of the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra’s rapturously received <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/21/proms2007.proms">performance at the 2007 BBC Proms</a> in London. The programme began to be hailed globally as a “miracle”, a glorious project that transforms the lives of Venezuela’s poorest children through classical music.</p>

<p>And now, as the domestic political tensions around El Sistema dramatically increase, the same dynamic is playing out again.</p>

<h2>Looking away</h2>

<p>As Venezuela’s political crisis has deepened and its economy all but collapsed, dissatisfaction with the state-funded music program has surged. Many Venezuelans particularly resent its iconic figurehead, the conductor <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/gustavo-dudamel-i-thought-john-williams-was-joking-when-he-asked/">Gustavo Dudamel</a>, whose high public profile, warm relations with top government figures and long-term silence over the escalating civil strife have alienated many of his compatriots.</p>

<p>This is a significant narrative kink in one of classical music’s biggest stories – and yet it was barely covered by the usually attentive media. When a government minister was captured on camera telling El Sistema’s employees to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMjwXc7hwNy/">toe the party line or find a new job</a>, there was a furore online, but mainstream journalists looked away. </p>

<p>But then, two developments finally caught their attention. </p>

<p>First, Sistema musician <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-venezuela-protests/">Armando Cañizales</a> was killed in an anti-government protest on May 3 2017. Dudamel responded with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/gustavo-dudamel/levanto-mi-voz-i-raise-my-voice/10155493367329683/">statement on Facebook</a> criticising the government. Then a Sistema violinist, Wuilly Arteaga, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/528072958/tear-gas-doesnt-stop-venezuelan-protester-from-playing-the-violin">became a fixture</a> in the anti-government marches, playing his violin in front of lines of riot police. </p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, these developments were picked up by major outlets including the New York Times, which headlined a major feature story with the words <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/world/americas/venezuela-protests-musicians-nicolas-maduro.html?_r=1">Venezuela Musicians Rise Up</a>. </p>

<p>In a few strokes, the coverage shifted from blithe neglect to breathless over-dramatisation. Media reports around the world cast Dudamel as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/04/venezuela-gustavo-dudamel-attacks-maduro">heroic resistance figure</a> issuing a “fiery statement” and “denouncing” the government, failing to take account of his long history of silence and many Venezuelans’ deep scepticism about him. That scepticism seems to have been little moved by the Facebook post, which many – including members of Cañizales’s family – saw as <a href="https://van-us.atavist.com/too-little-too-late">too little, too late</a>. </p>

<p>Dudamel has since returned to his habitual silence, interspersed with the occasional platitude about peace and unity, undermining the notion that he was leading an uprising as opposed to simply managing his image. Arteaga, meanwhile, has now left Venezuela for the US, where he is enjoying his 15 minutes of fame on the Latino chat-show circuit.</p>

<h2>Business as usual</h2>

<p>After Cañizales’s death, <a href="http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/entretenimiento/musicos-del-sistema-protestaron-por-muerte-armando-canizales_180520">around 50 musicians</a> staged a protest outside the Sistema headquarters. The largest banner declared that “El Sistema cannot sound the same”. Yet with 827,000 musicians currently enrolled in El Sistema, according to official figures, a tiny one-off protest hardly amounts to a musicians’ uprising. What’s genuinely striking is that nearly two months after the protest, El Sistema in fact does sound the same.</p>

<p>It pays to think about what hasn’t happened. There has been no organised orchestral protest, no mass resignations, no refusal to go on the international tours that the government funds for propaganda purposes. No leading conductor or soloist has publicly resigned over the increasing use of Sistema orchestras for political ends. <a href="http://gustavodudamel.com/us-en/schedule">Dudamel’s schedule</a> continues to show overseas engagements with El Sistema’s top orchestras. </p>



<p>The isolated actions of a few individuals do not suggest that El Sistema is, as <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-venezuelan-governments-newest-opponent-is-a-state-funded-orchestra-79975">one writer</a> recently called it, “the Venezuelan government’s newest opponent”. With its near-monopoly on classical music in Venezuela, the program still exerts significant control over its musicians – and it remains firmly aligned with the regime. Some rank-and-file members might join the protesters, but its leaders <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BTkumM5gIAN/">march for the government</a>.</p>

<p>Cañizales died in an anti-government protest, but that doesn’t mean he is representative of hundreds of thousands of his fellow musicians. Indeed, Wuilly Arteaga, the now-famous violinist of the protests, left El Sistema before he emerged as an iconic musical hero; he has <a href="http://elcooperante.com/sin-pelos-en-la-lengua-wuilly-arteaga-revelo-los-vicios-politicos-dentro-de-el-sistema/">criticised his former colleagues</a> for their political complicity and hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The recent attempts to paint Dudamel and El Sistema as heroes of the resistance are simply the latest in a long line of romanticised misrepresentations. A more representative figure would be the first Sistema musician to become a cause célèbre in this year’s protests, horn-player <a href="http://www.univision.com/noticias/protestas/yo-soy-musico-los-gritos-de-un-joven-para-evitar-su-arresto-durante-una-protesta-en-venezuela">Frederick Chirino Pinto</a> – who made it clear he was not in fact joining in, but simply on his way to a rehearsal.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80500/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

This new status would be evidenced with a residence document, including the possible collection of biometric data. </p>

<p>The suggestion immediately raised concerns that the government was introducing ID cards <a href="http://www.libdems.org.uk/davey_is_government_pushing_id_cards_through_the_backdoor">by the backdoor</a>. The previous Labour government’s plans to introduce national ID cards proved deeply unpopular and were ultimately scrapped by the coalition government. </p>

<p>At first glance, the proposal seems deeply ironic. It was, after all, David Davis, the secretary of state for exiting the EU, who campaigned for so many years against ID cards. In 2008, when he was shadow home secretary, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/12/speeches">resigned his seat</a> in opposition to the then Labour government’s record on civil liberties. And in 2014, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/04/mps-david-davis-and-tom-watson-in-court-challenge-over-surveillance-act">launched a legal challenge</a> against the coalition government’s <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/27/pdfs/ukpga_20140027_en.pdf">Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/12/mp-david-davis-calls-limit-uk-surveillance-powers-european-court-justice">arguing</a> that the government was infringing on civil liberties in seeking to store citizens’ data.</p>

<p>But in fact, his support for residence documents for EU citizens living in the UK shouldn’t be a surprise at all. Davis of course <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/06/civil-liberties-david-davis-has-become-complete-hypocrite-and-im-not-sure-he">denies</a> that EU citizens will be forced to carry ID cards – merely have “documentation” to prove their status. But despite his former abhorrence of ID cards, his backing of documentation for EU citizens actually fits neatly with his value system and conception of national identity.</p>

<p>When he resigned as an MP, Davis <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7451552.stm">criticised</a> what he called the “insidious, surreptitious and relentless erosion of fundamental British freedoms”. His opposition to ID cards was based on his <a href="http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/2006/02/david_davis_lea.html">argument</a> that they erode the “hard-won rights of British people”. He did <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/26/idcards.civilliberties">oppose</a> ID cards for non-UK nationals too, but on the basis that their use would mark “the start of the introduction of compulsory ID cards for all by stealth” rather than a point of principle about the freedoms of foreigners in the UK.</p>

<p>His opposition to the EU has taken a similar form. Recently, <a href="http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/02/david-davis-britain-would-be-better-off-out-of-the-eu-and-heres-why.html">he argued</a> that remaining in the EU would sacrifice “real opportunities to improve the lot of our people”. In the same speech, he praised the historical foundations of the European project, but maintained that “this history is not our history”. Davis defends what he sees as “British” values, based on his understanding of British history and traditions. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.zora.uzh.ch/41247/1/wep_bornschier.pdf">Scholars</a> have argued that there is a new cleavage in globalised societies between those who hold liberal, universalist values and those who subscribe to a more traditionalist worldview. The latter seek to defend exclusive communities based on shared cultural traditions. They tend to promote national sovereignty, restrictions on immigration, and traditional moral values. Such worldviews stand in opposition to universalist values that promote, for example, an internationalist outlook, cultural diversity, and human rights.  </p>

<p>It’s clear that, for Davis, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1465116505057816">national identity</a> is an exclusive concept. He has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/08/david-davis-stasi-gestapo-surveillance-tory-civil-liberties">rejected</a> the idea that he opposed ID cards because of libertarian values, calling himself a “rule of law enthusiast” who was defending, in his words, “the judicial tradition of Britain”. He also defends traditional moral values, by <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10162/david_davis/haltemprice_and_howden/divisions?policy=826">opposing</a> same-sex marriage and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3274245.stm">calling for</a> a reintroduction of the death penalty.</p>

<p>To Davis, being European is fundamentally incompatible with being British. He did not oppose ID cards because he is committed to the universal rights of the individual, but because he viewed them as contrary to “British traditions”. It is likely that in his view, EU nationals have little right to expect enjoyment of the “British freedoms” he has long defended. Rather, such rights are to be reserved exclusively for British citizens.</p>

<h2>Closed club</h2>

<p>The value divide that explains much of Davis’ politics also lies behind Brexit more generally. And pursuing this agenda will only deepen it. We know that identities become <a href="http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9783319516103">strengthened</a> and more polarised in periods of crisis. In order to make sense of events such as Brexit, we interpret them according to existing identities and understanding of the world, which entrenches them further. </p>

<p>Since the referendum, the government has constructed a narrow and exclusive conception of the national community. Brexit has been framed as the clear and emphatic <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/02/theresa-may-dare-parliament-defy-will-people-loses-article-50/">“will of the people”</a>. This despite the narrow result and the fact that so many people who stood to lose rights were excluded from the franchise. The government’s proposal on EU citizens’ rights is merely a formalisation of this exclusive, traditionalist conception of the national community.</p>



<p><a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/personal-values-brexit-vote/">Studies</a> have also shown that support for traditionalist values were a strong predictor of voting Leave. But when my colleagues and I conducted a survey of people attending the pro-EU <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/unite-for-europe-brexit-march-london-edinburgh-tens-of-thousands-against-european-union-eu-latest-a7649686.html">March for Europe</a> in London, we found that one of the most common concerns was that Britain is shifting away from being an inclusive, cosmopolitan, internationalist country, and towards intolerance and xenophobia. Many also expressed concern about a loss of human rights and environmental protections, and feared a breakdown of international cooperation and social solidarity.</p>

<p>On a personal level, EU citizens spoke of being treated as “second-class citizens”, unwelcome in the UK but, having been resident here for so long, also alien in their country of origin. And British citizens who voted for Remain expressed the feeling that they had been “robbed” of their European identities, that Brexit clashes with their fundamental, core belief in diversity and liberalism.</p>

<p>The proposal to create a <em>de facto</em> register of EU citizens means that they will be officially re-categorised as a distinct group with a smaller set of rights. They might be allowed to live in the same geographical space, but a division is to be drawn between British citizens and EU citizens nonetheless. </p>

<p>The government’s proposal to require EU citizens to prove their status with official documents does not clash with Davis’ opposition to ID cards. It actually allows him to defend the very same exclusive conception of “British traditions” that also drove him to oppose ID cards in the first place. His views reflect a broader division in the UK – and one that is not likely to disappear in the immediate future.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80567/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

They have subjected the Yezidis to killing, serious bodily or mental harm, and the infliction of conditions calculated to bring about their physical destruction. </p>

<p>Our <a href="https://academic.oup.com/hrlr/article-abstract/17/2/261/3746068/Calling-ISIL-Atrocities-Against-the-Yezidis-by?redirectedFrom=fulltext">research</a> examined the evidence for genocide, which included reports of the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/escape_from_hell_-_torture_and_sexual_slavery_in_islamic_state_captivity_in_iraq_-_english_2.pdf">horrific acts</a> of gender violence carried out against the Yezidis. In its online propaganda magazine Dabiq, IS detailed its “religious justification” for a policy of rape, sexual violence and slavery. IS specifically singled out Yezidi females for persecution and differentiated them from other religions. Whereas Muslims, Christians and Jews are considered to be “people of the book”, the Yezidis are considered pagans and labelled as “devil worshippers”.</p>

<p>A United Nations <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session28/Documents/A_HRC_28_18_AUV.doc">report</a> found evidence of “widespread and systematic enslavement, including selling of women, rape, and sexual slavery, forced transfer of women and children and inhuman and degrading treatment”. IS are <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/un-envoy-sickened-by-rampant-is-sexual-violence/">known</a> to have attacked villages and then divided the inhabitants by gender, executing any males aged 14 and above. </p>

<p>The report by the UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict goes on: “The women and mothers are separated; girls are stripped naked, tested for virginity and examined for breast size and prettiness. The youngest, and those considered the prettiest virgins fetch higher prices and are sent to Raqqa, the IS stronghold.” </p>

<p>Sheikhs get first choice, then emirs, then fighters. They often take three or four girls each and keep them for a month or so, until they grow tired of a girl, when she goes back to market. At slave auctions, buyers haggle fiercely, driving down prices by disparaging girls as flat chested or unattractive.</p>

<p>Many of the women and girls were regarded as chattels, imprisoned in houses and held in sexual slavery. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/14/iraq-isis-escapees-describe-systematic-rape">Human Rights Watch documented</a> a system of organised rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery and forced marriage by IS forces. As with enslavement, there was evidence that religious “justifications” had been accepted and followed by IS members to dehumanize Yezidi victims and rape them. </p>

<p>In one case before he raped a 12-year-old girl, an Islamic State fighter explained to her that what he was about to do was not a sin. Because the girl practised a religion other than Islam, he insisted, the Qur'an not only gave him the right to rape her – it condoned and encouraged it. He bound her hands and gagged her, then prostrated himself in prayer before and after the rape.</p>

<p>Another victim, a 15-year-old girl who was captured on Mount Sinjar and sold to an Iraqi fighter in his 20s said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every time that he came to rape me, he would pray. He kept telling me this is <em>ibadah</em> [worship]. He said that raping me is his prayer to God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also appears that many of the women and girls held in captivity were repeatedly transferred to different locations in IS-controlled territory – some to as many as ten different locations in a four-month period. This regular movement was apparently aimed at reinforcing IS control over the victims by instilling feelings of fear, insecurity and disorientation. </p>



<p>The Yezidis were particularly vulnerable to such treatment because of the strong value they place on their home environment. According to a Yezidi scholar: “For the Yezidis in particular, whose whole way of life is integrated into their religion, past and present events are closely linked to each other and to their environment. </p>

<p>"Locations are not only associated with past events, but also imbued with strong religious meanings.”</p>

<p>While these acts primarily constitute bodily or mental harm, they could also be described as deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of the group. The United Nations has previously declared that these conditions of life include rape. </p>

<h2>Crimes against communities</h2>

<p>International law expert <a href="http://mcherifbassiouni.com">Cherif Bassiouni</a> notes that under Islamic law, women who have had sexual relations outside of marriage – including ones that are forced upon them – are not “marriageable”. Enslavement, rape and sexual violence should be viewed not only as crimes against the individual. They should also be viewed as intended to desecrate the ways that members of communities – male and female – are bound together. There is no end to the nightmare.</p>

<p>Although the Yezidi community have tried to reintegrate women victims who have escaped, the stigma attached to such women is far reaching. Relatives of abducted Yezidi women and girls interviewed by Amnesty International expressed deep concerns not just about the suffering inflicted on their captured relatives, but also about the negative social consequences of the abductions for the future of these women and girls. </p>

<p>Some said that it would be difficult to find suitable husbands for those who had been abducted, even if they had not been victims of sexual violence, because it was assumed that all those abducted had been raped.</p>

<p>These crimes have the potential to permanently destroy a population’s capacity to rebuild itself as a stable and active group. Familial relationships break down and the victims of these crimes become ostracised, and are unable to marry or have children. </p>

<p>It is something that the perpetrators of genocide have known for centuries. A group can be destroyed – if you also destroy their ability to reproduce.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/77070/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

Official crime figures can be disputed, but <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/445662/rec-crime-2003-2015.ods">the long-term trend</a> appears to be that levels of crime in England and Wales are heading downward. Yet it is a myth to think that an apparent drop in crime relieves some of the pressures placed on police forces.</p>

<p>In reality, the demands placed on police forces do not originate primarily from obvious criminal behaviour. Forces are increasingly burdened with what’s called “latent” crime demand, such as child sexual exploitation or modern slavery, where victims are afraid or unwilling to approach police, as well as non-crime issues, such as missing persons. </p>

<p>The volume of this demand, and the time spent on addressing it, is much more problematic to estimate, and yet the safety of the public depends on both the police and the government having a handle on such estimations.</p>

<p>Out on the streets, police forces need to demonstrate an understanding of current and future demand to allocate resources efficiently and ensure calls are responded to in time. In Westminster, the funding allocations to the 43 forces of England and Wales are dictated by estimations of demand. In an era of austerity, measuring this demand has never been more crucial.</p>

<h2>Measuring demand</h2>

<p>Reports by the <a href="http://www.college.police.uk/News/College-news/Documents/Demand%20Report%2023_1_15_noBleed.pdf">College of Policing</a> and <a href="http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/wp-content/uploads/state-of-policing-2016.pdf">HM Inspectorate of Constabulary</a> (HMIC), have shown how the realities of modern policing render traditional estimates of demand outdated and inaccurate.</p>

<p>In its annual review of policing in England and Wales, HMIC rates how well each police force estimates the current and future demand for their services. For their latest report, published in <a href="http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/wp-content/uploads/state-of-policing-2016.pdf">March 2017</a> and covering inspections between February 2016 and March 2017, the message is clear: most forces are doing a good job, but there is room for improvement. </p>

<p>The map below, generated using open-source <a href="http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/3e5a096a8c7c456fb6d3164a3f44b005_0">spatial data</a>, plots the latest force ratings. It paints a positive picture for England and Wales, but nine out of 43 police forces require improvement, and only a handful managed to achieve the top grade.</p>

<p>A key component of improving police awareness of their demand will be refining the understanding of “latent” and non-crime demand. Latent demand often involves vulnerable people who are unwilling to come forward due to the nature of the crime, or live in communities with a widespread distrust of the police. It is therefore extremely difficult to make reliable estimations about this kind of demand on police time. </p>

<p>A substantial proportion of the demands placed on police forces originate from non-crime issues such as mental health. Although <a href="https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmhaff/476/47608.htm">estimates</a> vary, some forces estimate that 70% to 80% of their demand is comprised of non-crime incidents. A number of forces <a href="https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmhaff/476/47608.htm">believe</a> that the increase in non-criminal incidents being dealt with by the police may be partially driven by cuts to other areas of the public sector. </p>

<h2>Money depends on it</h2>

<p>To ensure that police forces are allocated money appropriately, in the interests of public safety and economic efficiency, the government also needs to demonstrate an understanding of demand. The issue of police funding remains a highly charged one, and budget cuts were <a href="https://theconversation.com/fact-check-have-the-conservatives-protected-police-and-counter-terrorism-budgets-78782">keenly debated</a> during the 2017 election campaign. </p>

<p>The map here uses recent police funding <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/588196/Police_Grant_report_2017-18_Accessible.pdf">figures</a> to demonstrate the vast sums of public money involved, and how much these sums can vary between police force areas.</p>

<p>Despite the implications and public concern over police funding, refining the formula used to apportion money has been fraught with difficulties. A <a href="https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmhaff/476/476.pdf">December 2015 report</a> by MPs on the Home Affairs Committee demonstrated the problems the government has faced when attempting to estimate demand for the purposes of funding allocations. It detailed how a freshly proposed police funding formula, which aimed to simplify the estimation process, was almost immediately put on hold following the realisation that incorrect data was being used for the calculation. Although a <a href="https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhaff/1093/1093.pdf">new government consultation</a> on a revised funding calculation was launched in September 2016, its outcome has not yet been announced. </p>

<h2>The role of experts</h2>

<p>Academic researchers are often <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/04/09/academic-promotion-scholars-popular-media/">justifiably scolded</a> for not engaging with real-world discussions, and failing to offer practical solutions to contemporary problems in society. Yet here they clearly have something to offer.</p>

<p>HMIC <a href="http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/wp-content/uploads/state-of-policing-2016.pdf">reported</a> that some police forces have made significant improvements to their demand estimations by working with academic research institutions who can provide much needed methodological expertise. But such collaborations are not widespread. Only recently has there been an acceptance that a concerted collaborative effort, including academic experts, is required to improve the government’s demand-based funding formula. Hopefully in this way past errors by the Home Office can be rectified, and trust in the system restored.</p>

<p>Recent history tells us that collaborations can be fruitful, and that there is the potential to drastically improve estimations of demand through such partnership. Academics, police forces and the government must bear the responsibility of instigating further change. The safety of the public may depend on it.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/79288/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

The 1814-15 Congress of Vienna marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the beginning of Europe’s “long” 19th century, during which Europe’s interactions were regulated by a relatively stable balance of power. The 1945 <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sections/history-united-nations-charter/1945-san-francisco-conference/">San Francisco Conference</a> put an end to the 20th century’s world wars and ushered a rules-based, liberal international order under the multilateral stewardship of the UN.</p>

<p>These were truly special affairs, and rare too, what with the logistics and risks of bringing leaders together to meet face-to-face. But revolutions in transportation have made this no longer so, and any national leader’s calendar is now stuffed with summits all year round. They generally don’t exactly define centuries and epochs, and they often barely command enough attention to survive a modern news cycle.</p>

<p>So it’s tempting to  consign this year’s G20 summit in Hamburg to the long list of those that don’t amount to much as far as the long gaze of history is concerned. But, in time, it might be remembered as something rather momentous: the summit that marked the symbolic – if not substantive – end of America’s international leadership.</p>

<p>Above and beyond the day-to-day stories of Donald Trump’s mishaps and bizarre behaviour, the American-led international order as we know it is disintegrating. This is a fundamental transition; under Trump, the US continues to retreat from its traditional role as the global guarantor of stability and security, leaving the EU and China to jostle for the mantle of leadership.</p>

<p>Political support for American internationalism began to fray in the mountains of Afghanistan and the deserts of Iraq during George Bush’s tenure in the Oval Office. The ebbing of leadership was authoritatively signalled with Barack Obama’s <a href="https://theconversation.com/drafts/80500/edit">apparent inclination</a> to “lead from behind”, especially evident in the West’s Libyan intervention; it was confirmed by his reluctance to enforce his own red line in Syria and to guarantee the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Trump’s <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/23/as-promised-trump-pulls-the-plug-on-the-trans-pacific-partnership/">decision to pull the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> and the <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/01/trump-pulls-out-of-the-paris-climate-agreement/">Paris climate agreement</a> were the next steps in this slow walk away from global leadership.</p>

<p>So what next – and indeed, who next to lead?</p>

<h2>East and West</h2>

<p>In their different ways, the EU and China are both positioned to fill the vacuum left by America’s abdication. As the host of this year’s summit, Angela Merkel is best able to steer things to Europe’s advantage. This is especially so now she’s accompanied by Emmanuel Macron who is ready and willing to spend his newly-won political capital on shoring up European unity – a job made easier by Brexit, with Britain giving up the position that allows it to play spoiler in Brussels.</p>

<p>Germany’s <a href="https://www.g20.org/Content/DE/_Anlagen/G7_G20/2016-g20-praesidentschaftspapier-en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=">agenda for the summit</a> focuses closely on shoring up the existing multilateral order, keeping the likes of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and so on at the centre of the global governance architecture. The aim is to keep the liberal, multilateral, rules-based order in place, even if America is no longer willing to underwrite it.</p>



<p>But China too is working to clinch the top spot, most notably by continually reaffirming its commitment to the sort of internationalism that was formerly an American hallmark. It’s doubling down on its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/as-us-backs-away-from-climate-pledges-india-and-china-step-up/2017/06/01/59ccb494-16e4-4d47-a881-c5bd0922c3db_story.html">commitment to the Paris agreement</a>, pursuing its <a href="https://theconversation.com/chinas-grand-geopolitical-project-threatens-a-new-east-west-divide-in-europe-79477">Belt and Road</a> development agenda with unyielding zeal, and <a href="http://english.gov.cn/premier/news/2016/09/20/content_281475446661058.htm">championing the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals</a>. </p>

<p>What’s significant is not that China is taking a lead part on the world’s stage while America stumbles towards the wings, but that in doing so, it’s following the liberal, multilateral, rules-based script rehearsed by America for the past 70-odd years.</p>

<p>Regardless of who is able to steer things their way, all signs suggest that even as America forfeits its privileged position, those willing to take its place are ready to lead according to the same mechanisms – if not principles – that defined the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/opinion/trumps-chinese-foreign-policy.html?_r=0">Pax Americana</a>. When the G20 release this year’s communique on July 8, it might be the best clue yet to who will lead the multilateral order – and how.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80335/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

At its darkest it can result in threats of physical harm – women, in particular, can be the targets of vile and <a href="http://www.thedebrief.co.uk/news/opinion/i-ve-had-death-and-rape-threats-simply-for-starting-the-conversation-about-everyday-sexism-2014049602">distressing abuse</a>. </p>

<p>For some it has actually meant dropping stories completely because of attacks by organised gangs, according to a <a href="https://www.academia.edu/33750163/Fair_game_Journalists_experiences_of_online_abuse">new survey</a> by the University of Central Lancashire’s Journalism and Media department.</p>

<p>Criticism of journalists is nothing new, but the ease of commenting on social media and publishers’ own sites has made personal abuse more public, allowing online gangs to form concerted attacks on social media or on media companies’ own sites.   </p>

<p>Trolls may co-ordinate attacks on a password-protected site, then simultaneously move to harass a journalist on a public site, such as Twitter. They may even move offline – for example in the “<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mumsnet-hack-founder-justine-roberts-targeted-in-swatting-attack-and-parenting-website-pushed-10461558.html">swatting</a>” of Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts, when a troll reported to police that a gunman had been seen near her house, resulting in armed officers appearing at Roberts’ home.</p>

<p>Of 267 mostly British journalists who took part in an online survey, only 6% said they had never experienced online abuse, and 15% said they had dropped stories that they knew would lead to trouble.</p>

<h2>Insults and threats</h2>

<p>Female news reporters were most likely to say they received abuse often, followed by male news reporters, with sport and features writers experiencing less frequent problems. More than 40% of female news journalists reported receiving sexual insults. More than 60% reported personal insults, compared to about half of male news journalists. About one-third of both male and female journalists said they had received threats.  </p>

<p>Female journalists reported stronger and more frequent emotional reactions, with 95% saying they were sometimes or often upset, compared to 74% of men. Two-thirds of women said they had been very upset, compared to one-third of men; and 45% said they had been frightened, compared to 20% of men. Nearly everyone said they had been angry and nearly 30% of men and 40% of women said they were often angry.</p>

<p>A free and independent press has always depended on a tough-minded, thick-skinned attitude – and it’s a matter of pride in most newsrooms that staff won’t be intimidated. This is a vital part of their role as a watchdog in holding politicians and others in authority to account.</p>

<p>When I put together this survey, I didn’t expect anyone to admit to dropping a story because of trouble online. I was shocked to hear that even one person would admit self-censoring, but when you read the kind of attacks they face, you can hardly blame them.</p>

<p>One survey respondent recalled being targeted by a famous singer’s fans after he wrote a story they considered insulting. Their campaign included death threats and setting up webpages in his name requesting child pornography. His bank account was also hacked.</p>

<p>Another male journalist wrote: “It is very difficult to return to subjects which led to adverse comments and insults. I find myself engaging in self-censorship.” This threatens the independence of the press. </p>

<h2>Dealing with the problem</h2>

<p>Managers have long sought ways to <a href="http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/8377/1/8377_Binns.pdf">deal with the problem</a> including robust <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/22/the-web-we-want-how-do-we-make-the-guardian-a-better-place-for-conversation">moderation policies</a>. Journalists have reported creating new identities online and asking colleagues to respond to attacks, replying both publicly and privately.</p>

<p>This survey was carried out before Donald Trump’s attacks on journalists became routine. It is a concern that this kind of abuse may be legitimised and encouraged by his actions, particularly after his link this week to a fan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/02/business/media/trump-wrestling-video-cnn-twitter.html?_r=0">video</a> of Trump hamming it up before a wrestling crowd in a ringside physical tussle, with the head of his opponent replaced by the red CNN logo. Needless to say, the network was not amused and accused the president of encouraging violence against journalists.</p>

<figure class="align-center ">

              <span class="caption">Many journalists may be able to laugh off a lot of abuse as playground stuff, but it can get very wearing.</span>
              <span class="attribution"><a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/download/confirm/630414212?size=huge_jpg&amp;src=lb-59856941&amp;sort=newestFirst&amp;offset=7">Shutterstock</a></span>

          </figure>

<p>An invisible consequence is the effect on online debate. More than half of respondents said they no longer read the comments under their articles which means they cease to interact directly with their readership. One said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a male, much of the abuse is pretty trivial – stupid playground stuff. Yet the sheer volume can be wearying. The problem is that there is sometimes gold hidden in comments. But you have to wade through the shit to reach it. I prefer not to work in sewers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So legitimate readers are punished for the behaviour of a small number of abusive users. At the extreme end, some sites have turned off the comment function altogether because moderation was simply too time-consuming to be profitable. These include major news providers such as <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/12/17/no-comment/#UBa6dnEVROqD">The Week, Reuters, Popular Science</a> and South African news site <a href="http://m.fin24.com/fin24/Tech/News/Record-response-to-News24s-comments-move-20150909">news24.com</a>. </p>

<p>There’s obviously value in being bloody-minded, but the British press has long been criticised for arrogance. Abuse may exacerbate this as journalists refuse to engage with readers online and create a further divide between the press and its audience, when a closer relationship is needed.</p>

<p>This survey was conducted mostly among British media, but the issues arising from abuse of journalists and the effect it is having on debate is a worldwide problem. I am now working on an international survey with <a href="http://www.troll-busters.com/">Trollbusters</a> which seeks to help journalists facing abuse. Journalists are welcome to take part <a href="http://bit.ly/journoharassment">here</a>.</p>

<p>The more we know about online abuse of journalists, the better we can work out how to effectively neuter it.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80531/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

As far as the West is concerned, it was clearly just the latest in a long line of chemical weapon attacks <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/07/syrias-chemical-weapons-kill-chain-assad-sarin/">authorised by the Syrian president</a>, Bashar al-Assad; a recent <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/syria/events/article/chemical-attack-in-syria-national-evaluation-presented-by-jean-marc-ayrault">French intelligence report</a> lists seven sarin attacks which it either presumes or is confident were ordered by the regime – this in addition to some 22 incidents of chlorine use. </p>

<p>All this is broadly in keeping with public statements and declassified reports released by other Western states. From a Western perspective, the Assad regime has for years now played cat-and-mouse with the international community, using chemical weapons to kill, terrorise, demoralise and displace both militants and civilians. He has attempted to employ such weapons below the threshold that would trigger greater Western intervention, or the threshold which might lead Russia or another ally to withdraw vital support. </p>

<p>These thresholds are neither clear nor stationary – and Damascus has hedged its bets time and time again on the benefits of use. This included the use of chemical weapons at, and in the run up to, the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2013/09/10/attacks-ghouta/analysis-alleged-use-chemical-weapons-syria">2013 Ghouta attack</a>. It was also reflected in Assad’s decision to <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/08/23/u-s-and-europe-say-assad-may-have-kept-some-chemical-weapons/">secretly retain</a> sarin stockpiles when it was forced to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-23876085">give up</a> its chemical weapons in the aftermath of the Ghouta massacre. From this perspective, the persistent use of chlorine by the regime also fits the pattern. </p>

<p>The Syrian and Russian governments have consistently publicly denied that the Syrian government has ever employed chemical weapons, either before or after it <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/files/Panel2.1_Anelli_TuckerConference.pdf">declared</a> and destroyed some 1,000 tonnes of chemical agents and decommissioned some 27 production facilities. But, more than that, Russian and Syrian officials still challenge the Western narrative by questioning whether the attacks in question were staged, carried out by rebels or – as in the latest case – a consequence of rebel groups stockpiling sarin supplies of their own. They argue that pinning chemical weapon use on Assad is a Western tactic to undermine his regime – and to leverage public support for Western intervention. </p>

<p>These sorts of denials, accusations and counter-accusations are a long-established feature of chemical warfare, where the facts and meaning of individual attacks become flashpoints in the broader narrative battles. Indeed, while the players have changed, the games being played now look much like the propoganganda wars over Iraq’s war crimes during the Iran-Iraq War – in particular the notorious 1988 chemical massacre at <a href="https://theconversation.com/haunted-by-the-smell-of-apples-28-years-on-kurds-weep-over-halabja-massacre-55979">Halabja</a>. </p>

<h2>Framed and reframed</h2>

<p>The parallels are ironic and tragic. In the late 1980s, it was the West which stood accused of giving tacit support to Saddam’s chemical weapon programme, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/17/opinion/halabja-america-didnt-seem-to-mind-poison-gas.html">allowing atrocities which could have been prevented</a> in the service of its fierce opposition to Iran. The Iranian media, meanwhile, was particularly eager to draw attention to what Iraq was doing on the ground, but its obvious tactical stakes in the conflict <a>damaged the credibility</a> of early reports about chemical war crimes.</p>

<p>While war crimes are routinely denied by their perpetrators, chemical weapons are unique. There is a highly developed international apparatus in place to investigate and attribute their use – and the intense scrutiny that follows a chemical attack means there’s a much greater public expectation that action will be taken against culprits. In the Syrian case, this particular dynamic has given chemical weapons a special symbolic weight. </p>



<p>The West’s insistence on publicly attributing attacks to the Assad regime effectively implicates Russia, the government’s principal supporter. This is deeply resented in Moscow. US <a href="https://theconversation.com/trump-strikes-in-syria-illegal-ineffective-and-dangerous-75936">missile strikes</a> after Khan Sheikhoun, strategically inconsequential though they were, will only have driven home the impression that the US and its allies are cynically using the chemical weapons issue for both domestic and diplomatic leverage.</p>

<p>In response, Russia is trying to frame this Western activism as a challenge to the independence of UN organisations and investigations. It has questioned the methods employed by a recent UN-OPCW joint investigation that <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=s/2016/738">concluded</a> the Syrian Air Force had used chlorine as a weapon. Unsurprising then that Russian officials are <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2017/04/19/518617/Syria-Lavrov-Syria-OPCW-probes-British-citizens">publicly dismissive</a> of the latest UN investigation into the Khan Sheikhoun attack.</p>

<p>While that investigation’s latest report demonstrates beyond any doubt that sarin was employed as a weapon, it does not explicitly deal with the question of attribution. Nonetheless, its findings cast further doubt on the claims made by Syrian and Russian officials in the wake of the attack that a <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/383522-syria-idlib-warehouse-strike-chemical/">rebel chemical stockpile stockpile was hit</a>, instead identifying the source of the sarin cloud as a crater some distance from the supposed stockpile. A joint UN-OPCW investigation into the attack is already underway; it has a remit to attribute the attack.</p>

<h2>Real and surreal</h2>

<p>Russia will continue to publicly voice reservations about the investigation’s attribution of responsibility; it will keep trying to derail, discredit or delay the process, citing concerns about the investigators’s methods. It will also keep pushing the idea that Western actions threaten to undermine the chemical weapon prohibition regime – something which nobody wants to happen.</p>

<p>What is at stake in these arguments is both bigger and smaller than the question of Syrian chemical weapons. At a human level, while real people have been killed by real weapons, the heightened attention paid to this particular issue has at once made the war feel almost surreal to Western populations. While most people surely agree that those who commit atrocities must be punished, they are rightly sceptical of the claims which different sides make in times of war. </p>

<p>Cynicism increasingly dominates, with the international response to the use of these weapons discussed as a dismal pantomime, a sad display of the hubris, futility and hypocrisy of seeking to enforce moral limits on warfare. All sides in this conflict invoke grand ideas of justice, sovereignty, national security, peace and international institution-building. </p>

<p>Once the dust settles, it will be clearer what sacrifices have actually been made in the name of these causes. But for now, the point is to ensure that leaders don’t ignore or forget these ongoing war crimes, whoever commits them. In particular, the UN-OPCW investigation needs as much support as it can get as it seeks to formally attribute the attack. So do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/04/world/middleeast/syria-war-crimes-prosecution-united-nations.html?mcubz=1">broader ongoing enquiries</a> into Syrian atrocities, as well as more grassroots movements and documentation programmes investigating this conflict’s myriad heinous crimes.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80493/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

It has been translated into dozens of languages, made into a film in 1990, and even became a ballet and an opera. It is read in schools the world over. Most recently, there has been a new wave of interest in the dystopian story thanks to the TV adaptation by MGM and Hulu.</p>

<p>However, it isn’t the adaptation alone that has caused this popularity, the novel has seen a reported <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/02/07/513957906/margaret-atwoods-the-handmaids-tale-soars-to-top-of-amazon-bestseller-list">200%</a> increase in sales since Donald Trump was elected as US president.</p>

<p>The series takes place in the fictional nation state of Gilead (established in North America after an uprising has overthrown the US government and murdered the US president and Congress). There, a Christian theocracy has dealt with a global fertility crisis by enslaving fertile women. They are systematically raped by high-ranking officials in order to bear children for the new nation. Filmed during the 2016 election race, the <a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/story/handmaids-tale-hulu-margaret-atwood-elisabeth-moss">cast and crew has since spoken</a> about how political events gave a whole new weight to the series.</p>

<p>And since the series has been aired, it has fed back into politics. Women have been dressing as handmaids to express their anger, frustration and dissent in a relatable and visually striking way. By dressing in these instantly recognisable costumes the handmaids have been bearing witness to federal and state attempts to limit women’s reproductive choices.</p>

<p>While there are some clear differences between Atwood’s Gilead and Trump’s current US administration (for one, climate change is a government priority in Gilead), increasing threats to women’s reproductive rights in the US have led protestors to adopt the message and aesthetic of The Handmaid’s Tale.</p>

<p>Placards have been spotted at anti-Trump protests bearing slogans such as “The Handmaid’s Tale is not an instruction manual” and “Make Margaret Atwood fiction again”.</p>

<p>Women brought up in certain communities in the US have also been <a href="https://theestablishment.co/i-grew-up-in-a-fundamentalist-cult-the-handmaids-tale-was-my-reality-fae2f77263d9">drawing similarities</a> between their experiences and The Handmaid’s Tale. One described a movement called Quiverfull, which raises women to be “helpmeets”, their purpose being to meet the needs of their husbands. The group is preparing for “<a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/i-was-trained-for-the-culture-wars-in-home-school-awaiting-someone-like-mike-pence-as-a-messiah-367057/">the culture wars</a>”, when they think they will have to uphold far-right evangelical christian values against attack. For these women, Atwood’s Gilead feels all-too familiar.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/books/review/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-age-of-trump.html">Atwood herself has stated</a> that far from being an imagined alternate universe, her book draws on real historical laws that have subjugated women and valued their childbearing abilities above all else. She calls the book “speculative fiction” rather than “science fiction”.</p>

<p>But the world depicted by The Handmaid’s Tale is feeling <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-the-handmaids-tale-is-being-transformed-from-fantasy-into-fact-77837?sa=google&amp;sq=handmaid%27s+tale&amp;sr=2">less and less speculative</a>. Particularly troubling examples include Senate bills in <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA132-SB-145">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://rewire.news/legislative-tracker/law/texas-dismemberment-abortion-ban-sb-415/">Texas</a> that would restrict women’s right to an abortion. These bills would effectively ban a safe and effective medical procedure in the second trimester and allow doctors to withhold information on the health of the foetus. </p>

<p>To protest these bills women dressed as handmaids and entered the Ohio and Texas senates. They stayed in character, walking the halls and listening to the debates in silence. The women were not asked to leave.</p>

<p>Trump has <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-signs-law-aimed-at-cutting-abortion-funding-a7683786.html">signed legislation</a> allowing states to cut funding to Planned Parenthood, a family planning organisation that also provides abortions. The availability of abortions in the US is already at a historic low. While Trump was previously pro-choice, he has <a href="http://www.refinery29.uk/2017/01/135307/donald-trump-abortion-quotes">declared himself pro-life since 2011</a>.</p>

<h2>A visual spectacle</h2>

<p>The striking aesthetic of the handmaids has clear visual appeal for protesters. Clothes signify a woman’s status in Gilead and the women singled out for their fertility are dressed in flowing red cloaks with large white bonnets to cover their hair and blinker them to the outside world. The series’ costume designer Ane Crabtree wanted the handmaids to look like “<a href="http://www.vulture.com/2017/04/handmaids-tale-costumes-how-they-came-together.html">walking wombs</a>”.</p>

<p>Atwood has explained the symbolism of the handmaid’s clothing saying “the handmaids wear red, from the blood of parturition, but also from Mary Magdalene. Also, red is easier to see if you happen to be fleeing”.</p>

<p><blockquote class="instagram-media" style="width: 100%" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="7">

<p>When the protesting handmaids turned up at the Texas and Ohio Senates in their shocking red robes and white bonnets, they brought the bills being debated inside into public consciousness.</p>

<p>It’s not just protesters who are aware of the power of such imagery. Joseph Fiennes, who plays a powerful commander in Gilead and is the owner of the series’ protagonist, Offred (played by Elizabeth Moss) has said that when he saw images of women dressed as handmaids ”<a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-st-handmaids-tale-elisabeth-moss-joseph-fiennes-emmys-20170517-htmlstory.html">my jaw was on the ground</a>“. Moss herself said that it’s "an image that stands so clearly for feminism and women’s rights. I don’t know many costumes or outfits in literature that someone could wear into an assembly and you immediately know why they’re there and what side they’re on.”</p>

<p>All the handmaid protests so far have taken place in the US. But with the anti-choice Democratic Unionist Party now holding the balance of power in the UK parliament – and with restrictive abortion laws in Ireland and <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-battle-over-abortion-rights-in-poland-is-not-over-66652">Poland</a> – it perhaps won’t be long before handmaids start appearing in other countries. The picture is even starker <a href="http://worldabortionlaws.com/">outside Europe</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the protests, restrictive laws are becoming reality. The Ohio governor has agreed to <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/12/what_does_ohios_new_20-week_ab.html">ban</a> abortions after 20 weeks and the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-bill-would-allow-obs-to-withhold-information-from-pregnant-women_us_58b85e8de4b01fc1bde6b9fc">Texan Bill</a> has moved onto the state senate for a vote.</p>

<p>The real-life handmaids are our reminder of what is at stake. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-37645942/atwood-handmaid-s-tale-has-become-a-meme-in-us-politics">Atwood</a> has noted that the handmaids protest because “somebody has to tell the Republicans the Handmaid’s Tale is not a blueprint”.</p>

<p>As women’s rights continue to be threatened, we may see more handmaids cropping up – warning us not to sleepwalk into Gilead.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80433/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>The ruling came a few days after Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons said Feltham A – the part of the institution for boys aged 15 to 18 – was “not safe for either staff or boys” in a <a href="https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprisons/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/06/Feltham-A-Web-2017.pdf">report</a> published after an unannounced inspection. Parts of the institution were described as “deeply troubling” with issues of violence, uses of restraint techniques and isolation deemed to be serious causes of concern. </p>

<p>Named AB in legal documentation, the child’s solitary confinement for <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/04/boy-16-wins-human-rights-ruling-prolonged-solitary-confinement/">more than 100 days</a> was <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/oa-ab-a-child-v-sosfj-and-others.pdf">ruled</a> on July 4 to have contravened Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> – the right to a private and family life. He <a href="http://howardleague.org/news/felthamsolitaryconfinementhighcourtjudgment/">was</a> locked in his cell for in excess of 22 hours a day, for more than 15 days in a row. </p>

<p>The judge, Justice Ouseley, explained that this denied the child the opportunity to an adequate education and to socialise with other inmates. But he dismissed the argument that the boy’s treatment was inhuman and degrading. The Howard League for Penal Reform, a charity whose legal team represents the boy, is <a href="http://howardleague.org/news/felthamsolitaryconfinementhighcourtjudgment/">now seeking</a> to appeal this part of the ruling.  </p>

<p>Despite the child’s challenging behaviour he deserves to have his rights respected and to access appropriate support for his mental health issues and special educational needs. However, the High Court ruling also failed to recognise his need for appropriate support. </p>

<p>Putting distressed children in cells for more than 100 days <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-prisons-child-inmates-solitary-confinement-un-torture-rules-young-offenders-institutes-break-jail-a7591781.html">only exacerbates</a> any pre-existing mental health problems, leaving them vulnerable to traumatic stress. The punishment is the <a href="http://scyj.org.uk/2017/07/scyj-responds-to-hmi-prisons-report-on-feltham-prison/">loss of liberty</a> and children should not be doubly punished by enduring ill treatment in poor conditions.  </p>

<h2>Unmet needs</h2>

<p>The child <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/francescrook/status/882250250777493506/photo/1">had</a> complex health and social care needs and adverse childhood experiences. But these were disregarded, with security concerns trumping the need for appropriate care – as it often does in custodial settings. He had attachment difficulties following a traumatic childhood that involved being subject to emotional and physical abuse. He suffered from bereavement and had witnessed domestic violence. He was on the child protection register and had had a number of residential placements. The boy was also diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder.  </p>

<p>There is a larger problem here: a disproportionate number of children in the youth justice system have experienced trauma. <a href="http://www.beyondyouthcustody.net/justice-system-retraumatising-vulnerable-young-people/">Research</a> has shown that 91% of young people who have committed violent offences had experienced abuse or loss. The prevalence of such trauma in custody can result in children becoming violent, committing sexual offences and misusing substances. Being in solitary confinement <a href="https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Unlocking-Potential.pdf">can also</a> trigger self-harm and intensify the symptoms of trauma. </p>

<h2>Access to support</h2>

<p>Young offender institutions and prisons generally do not have the right provisions, expertise and resources in place to support people who need to be cared for: an issue that has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/05/prison-funding-cuts-are-putting-vulnerable-prisoners-at-risk">intensified</a> following the onset of the government’s austerity programme. </p>

<p>Children with learning disabilities <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/joepublic/2008/dec/03/learning-disability-prison-learning-difficulties">are known</a> to be disadvantaged in prisons and to be more susceptible to bullying, segregation and depression. They can often struggle to follow written instructions relating to prison rules, to complete paperwork, or to make doctors’ appointments. It can be difficult for these children to comply and comprehend what is expected of them. Support tends to be one-size-fits-all – tailored treatment to individuals with learning disabilities is <a href="www.communitycare.co.uk/2009/02/27/people-with-learning-disabilities-in-prison-2/">seldom offered</a>. </p>

<p>Although the rights of children in custody ought not to lag behind the rights of children generally, child prisoners are particularly vulnerable to having their rights abused and should be safeguarded. The Feltham young offender case highlights a grim aspect of youth custody and is yet another indicator of the crisis afflicting prisons in which understaffing, <a href="https://theconversation.com/no-wonder-prisons-are-getting-more-violent-theyre-full-to-the-brim-65921">overcrowding</a>, lack of training and high staff turnover are creating a dire situation.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80514/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

On this measure, the rest of the world has so far failed – and that was made clearer than ever on July 4 2017, when Pyongyang claimed to have successfully tested an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/04/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test-icbm.html">intercontinental ballistic missile</a> for the first time. </p>

<p>If reports of the missile’s performance are accurate, Kim Jong-un may soon have the ability to hit US territory for the first time. Donald Trump previously <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/816057920223846400">said</a> this will never be allowed – and, sure enough, the US and South Korea responded to the test with a missile drill of their own in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-40503558">Sea of Japan</a>. </p>

<p>Trump has been banging this drum on and off since his presidency began – albeit very inconsistently. Heralding the end of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/obamas-strategic-patience-strategy-toward-north-korea-is-over-but-trump-could-make-the-region-safer-a7675161.html">Barack Obama’s policy</a> of “strategic patience”, he has ostensibly hardened the US’s stance on North Korea, saying that there is chance of a “major, major conflict” if the country does not curb its nuclear ambitions. </p>

<p>In April 2017, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-north-korea-nuclear-latest-war-a7710521.html">pressed</a> to say whether another nuclear test would trigger military action from the US, Trump said “we’ll see”. But in the same interview, Trump has gone on the record saying he would be “honored” to meet the North Korean president, Kim Jong-un, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/apr/30/trump-kim-jong-un-is-a-pretty-smart-cookie-video">praising</a> his counterpart as a “pretty smart cookie” and apparently empathising with him, noting that it must have been “hard” for Kim to take the reins at such a young age. </p>

<p>Observers saw this as yet another sign of Trump’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/04/the-many-north-korea-policies-of-rex-w-tillerson/524736/">ineptitude and incoherence</a>. But looked at another way, his apparently garbled messages could have value as a sort of extreme carrot-and-stick methodology, simultaneously threatening devastating military action and offering the ultimate diplomatic prize of a meeting with the US president himself. </p>

<p>This approach has so far yielded mixed results. </p>

<h2>Oil and coal</h2>

<p>On the plus side, the US’s behaviour of late may in fact be helping pressure China to properly reconsider its policy towards the north. As it said in a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/russia-china-korea-missile-test-unacceptable-170704145934120.html">statement jointly issued with Russia</a> after the latest test, Beijing considers Pyongyang’s weapons development “unacceptable” and would like to see the two Koreas negotiate in the interests of peace and stability.</p>

<p>The importance of China’s role should not be underestimated. Despite its <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/china-pushes-back-trumps-north-korea-rhetoric-20245">protestations to the contrary</a>, it is the only country with any significant leverage over Pyongyang: if it stops <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-nuclear-china-oil-idUSKBN17F17L">selling North Korea oil</a> and <a href="https://www.38north.org/2017/04/ysun040517/">buying its coal</a>, the North Korean economy would collapse. </p>

<p>This was previously thought of as a line China would never cross – but things could be changing. China has signalled that it is willing to consider slaying this sacred cow. In April 2017, in a <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1041998.shtml">Global Times editorial</a>, China issued an unprecedented public threat: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the North makes another provocative move this month, the Chinese society will be willing to see the UNSC adopt severe restrictive measures that have never been seen before, such as restricting oil imports to the North.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>North Korea’s state media <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/north-korean-state-media-lashes-main-ally-china-170504041539856.html">responded</a> by chiding China, telling Beijing not to “test the limits of [North Korea’s] patience”, further adding that China had “better ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by its reckless act of chopping down the pillar of [North Korean-Chinese] relations”. A Chinese riposte, again <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1045325.shtml">via the Global Times</a>, condemned North Korea’s statement as “hyper-aggressive” and “filled with nationalistic passion”. Pyongyang, it said, is “grappling with some form of irrational logic over its nuclear programme”. </p>

<p>The irony is surely not lost on China-watchers. As Beijing’s patience gets stretched to the limit, it may be forced to finally bring put some real pressure on its naughty neighbour.</p>

<h2>Tug of war</h2>

<p>Kim Jong-un and his progenitors have always relied on unpredictability as their main diplomatic and political tactic – but, with Trump in office, they no longer have a monopoly on quixotic behaviour. Mysteries about the administration’s North Korea policy abound. Did the US’s Carl Vinson aircraft carrier <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/world/asia/aircraft-carrier-north-korea-carl-vinson.html">sail to the Korean peninsula or not?</a> Why was the entire Senate <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-nuclear-usa-senate-idUSKBN17Q1LR">called to the White House</a> in April for a North Korea briefing? Will Trump order surgical strikes on North Korea? And what do his latest tweets mean?</p>

          <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It is par for the course for Kim Jong-un to broadcast war rhetoric because he has normalised it to such an extent that the international community expects it, but it’s quite another matter for the president of the US to follow suit. </p>

<p>Trump’s behaviour is ratcheting up the tension on a number of fronts. While the South Korea-Japan-US triangle is holding together, the early deployment of their joint <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-us-america-anti-missile-thaad-defense-system-south-north-korea-spying-donald-trump-military-a7713251.html">Terminal High Altitude Area Defence</a> (THAAD) missile system has provoked an outsize reaction from China. When the THAAD deployment began in earnest in early 2017, China responded by cracking down on <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-china-lotte-idUSKBN16D03U">Lotte Mart</a>, a South Korean discount retailer that agreed to furnish land for the placement of THAAD; many of its Chinese outlets were suddenly shut on vague pretexts. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, South Korea remains close to the US and Japan – the newly elected president, Moon Jae-in, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/south-korea-confident-north-peace-talk-moon-jae-in-meet-donald-trump-washington-a7819066.html">visited Trump in Washington</a> days before the July 4 test, where he sounded assured that Trump would not scotch his plans for some kind of diplomatic dialogue. </p>

<p>Trump also seems to have overestimated the personal rapport he built with Xi during their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39517569">meeting at Mar-a-Lago, Florida</a>, insisting that this translates into direct results with regards to reining in North Korea. For all the talk of oil and coal restrictions, the results they were meant to generate have not come to fruition. Xi, correspondingly, may have underestimated how much pressure he needs to apply on the Kim regime to <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/877234140483121152">keep Trump happy</a>.</p>

<p>With this latest missile breakthrough, Kim probably hoped to surprise the world yet again and continue bending it to his will. But he may have underestimated just how much Trump’s own penchant for the unexpected and contempt for losing has changed the calculus among the countries with a stake in stopping Pyongyang’s progress.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/77908/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) launched its customary joint manifesto together with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).</p>

<p>The document offers an insight into Merkel’s preferences for the “hot phase” of the campaign. More than the actual contents, the exclusions reveal the challenges facing the CDU as the leading party of government. The manifesto sidesteps some of the most controversial issues of the day and skims deftly over the issues that divide the CDU/CSU “union” parties. </p>

<p>The CDU/CSU election programme, entitled <a href="https://www.cdu.de/system/tdf/media/dokumente/170703regierungsprogramm2017.pdf?file=1">“For a Germany where we can live well and happily”</a>, is firmly rooted in domestic politics. Merkel’s profile as an international leader hardly needs reinforcement, but voters want answers to the day-to-day problems of growing social polarisation in Germany, rising rents, community conflicts over immigration, childcare and pensions.</p>

<p>The manifesto treads a careful path through this potential minefield. In particular, it aims to ease the pressure on working families. Key proposals include a reduction of income tax that will save German taxpayers €15 billion a year. The parties promise to achieve <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/angela-merkel-will-vollbeschaeftigung-im-jahre-2025-a-1155705.html">full employment by 2025</a> – that is, a reduction in the unemployment rate from its current level of 5.5% to under 3%. Immigration is presented as a means to achieve full employment, with incomers recruited on the basis of their contribution to the workforce. The unpopular <a href="https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article156698484/Nach-25-Jahren-muss-der-Soli-endlich-weg.html">“solidarity tax”</a> – a federal surcharge first introduced to fund the “equalisation” of living conditions in the east of Germany after German unification, is to undergo a phased withdrawal.</p>

<p>Child maintenance payments are to increase and there will be supplementary payments for young families who are first-time buyers. Tax breaks on new builds are to help offset Germany’s growing housing problem.</p>

<p>A second key theme is security. Protective infrastructure is to be beefed up and <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/angela-merkel-will-vollbeschaeftigung-im-jahre-2025-a-1155705.html">15,000</a> more police and security officials are to be recruited to meet the needs of the authorities at federal and regional level. In addition, data sharing across federal and regional authorities is to be improved.    </p>

<p>It’s clear that the Christian Democrats want to avoid controversial issues in the campaign. The manifesto contains <a href="https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article165968107/Ein-eigenes-Kapitel-zu-Fluechtlingen-gibt-es-im-Programm-der-Union-nicht.html">no distinct section on refugees</a>, immigration and Islam, even though this issue combination is high on the public agenda. The manifesto’s rebranding of immigrants as workers is an attempt to break the negative perceptions linking immigration and security that preoccupy the voters after a series of immigrant-led terrorist attacks in the country. Also, there is no attempt to set out a realistic reform of Germany’s ailing pensions policy, an unenviable task waiting for the next government. In the CDU/CSU manifesto, the outside world stops at EU borders.</p>

<p>In the context of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/03/calls-german-defence-minister-quit-over-military-scandals">army scandals</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-new-president-and-a-chance-for-germany-to-face-its-demons-72891">unpopular overseas military engagements</a>, defence and foreign policy are also risky in campaign terms. A bland restatement of Germany’s traditional multilateralism and a promise to commit more funding to the federal military forces are buried in a general section on security.</p>

<p>It’s also true that many of the proposals in the manifesto bear a strong resemblance to those put forward in the programme published by main rivals the Social Democrats (SPD). <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/wahlprogramm-der-union-wagt-sich-kaum-raus-aus-der-komfortzone-a-1155462.html">Both manifestos</a> carry central proposals on lowering income tax and the phased withdrawal of the solidarity tax. The SPD has been quick to complain about its ideas being stolen. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, this SPD has slumped in the polls, and not because its manifesto has been copied. Its main problem can be found closer to home. The latest <a href="http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/">Emnid</a> poll of July 1 shows the SPD running at 24% to the CDU/CSU’s 39%. The SPD launched <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/19/germanys-social-democrats-confirm-martin-schulz-angela-merkels">Martin Schulz</a> as its leading candidate in March, at a time when <a href="https://bundestagswahl-2017.com/angela-merkel/">Merkel’s popularity</a> had taken a hit over her refugee policy. After a promising start, the <a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/kaffeeklatsch/2017/05/schulz-effect-rip">Schulz effect</a> failed to deliver in key regional elections in Saarland, Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, leaving the SPD struggling to reignite its <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/martin-schulz-effect-fades-further-poll/">campaign</a>.</p>

<h2>The thorn in Merkel’s side</h2>

<p>Merkel is operating well within her comfort zone ahead of this vote. She already has three successful general election campaigns under her belt. However, there is still the possibility of a serious upset between now and September. Danger threatens less from other parties, such as the Social Democratic Party (SPD), than from the right-leaning opposition within her own party. And for Merkel, Bavarian state president <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/german-election-2017-horst-seehofer-bavaria-to-seek-re-election-as-state-premier-party-leader/">Horst Seehofer</a> is danger personified.</p>



<p>Seehofer is a man who speaks his mind, often at the cost of party unity. Representing the conservative-nationalist wing of the CDU/CSU, he condemned Merkel’s humanitarian handling of Germany’s refugee crisis as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/10/bavarian-leader-horst-seehofer-lashes-out-merkels-handling-refugee-crisis">“rule of injustice”</a>, a term which, in Germany, references an oppressive or illegitimate regime. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bayerischer-ministerpraesident-besucht-putin-seehofers-fehler-a-1075639.html">February 2016</a> he caused embarrassment with his freelance attempts at diplomacy in Russia. His criticism of EU sanctions against Russia flatly contradicted government policy.</p>

<p>Seehofer now describes his relationship with Merkel as <a href="https://www.merkur.de/politik/seehofer-verhaeltnis-zu-merkel-fast-innig-zr-8448790.html">“almost close”</a>, but party friends may fear that this détente – a triumph of hope over experience – could implode before election day or during any coalition negotiations to follow. </p>

<p>In return for his parliamentary party supporting a future government coalition, <a href="http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-und-csu-beschliessen-wahlprogramm-2017-zur-bundestagswahl-aid-1.6922909">Seehofer</a> is likely to demand a maximum quota on incoming migrants of 200,000 a year. An anticipated “Plan for Bavaria” will include this and <a href="http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-und-csu-beschliessen-wahlprogramm-2017-zur-bundestagswahl-aid-1.6922909">other demands</a> that have been screened out of Merkel’s anodyne manifesto. Whether he will get his own way will depend in part on the coalition arithmetic yielded by the vote on September 24. </p>

<p>Merkel is adamant in particular that there will be no maximum quota for migrant entry. But Seehofer will no doubt be gratified that in the coalition negotiations following the last federal election, Merkel conceded to SPD demands over the introduction of a minimum wage – another issue to which she was strongly opposed.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80447/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

People knew the swingeing State Department and foreign aid cuts the new president promised would hit Africa the hardest, but whereas the US is too embedded in the woes of the Middle East to scale back its costly operations there, Africa simply can’t match it for strategic value or public profile.</p>

<p>On the sidelines, however, serious thinkers were contemplating the future of the US in Africa, and as always happens in the jostling for position that accompanies new presidents in the US, people began to lay out their wares in the hopes of earning an appointment. And at the end of 2016, one in particular stood out: J Peter Pham of the <a href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/">Atlantic Council</a>, a foreign affairs think tank, who published a paper widely taken as an Africa policy manifesto for the new administration. </p>

<p>Entitled <a href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/publications/reports/a-measured-us-strategy-for-the-new-africa">A Measured US Strategy for the New Africa</a>, it uses the sober language of deliberate realism. Examining both the US’s interests and global security, it affirms that the US still has a mission to undertake in Africa, but not the one it has embarked on previously. Judging by what I heard on a recent visit, the Washington rumour mill now seems convinced Pham will be nominated as the US’s assistant secretary of state for Africa, a vital state department post that’s gone unfilled since Trump took office. So what does Pham’s “manifesto” for American Africa policy say about him?</p>

<h2>Old and new</h2>

<p>As his choice of title implies, Pham is apparently determined to upend old American perceptions of Africa; the tired old “dark continent” is nowhere to be seen in his paper. But while Pham doesn’t exactly say what the “new Africa” looks like, he does emphatically suggest that the US rein in its dealings with African states that can’t act like states – that can’t or don’t build structures to benefit their citizens, or earn proper legitimacy as both states and governments.</p>

<p>Pham also emphasises that the US should not look only to states, but to Africa’s rapidly developing private sector. The state, he says, cannot and should not do everything – a core Republican tenet of domestic policy transposed onto African affairs.</p>

<figure>
            <iframe width="440" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zc1e4LmEWnM?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            
          </figure>

<p>The paper is laden with such “selling points”. One, clearly calculated to appeal to an administration disinclined to rely on the state department is the open admission that that department needs “rationalisation” – in other words, cuts. How this is to be done is another question. So, it is being done by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/03/state-department-trump/517965/">not nominating anyone to fill key posts</a>, and by what the British courts would call “constructive dismissal”. But plenty of very real talent and experience is being lost. </p>

<p>And in a White House where the president’s son-in-law has become a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-jared-kushner-middle-east-trip-israel-palestine-jerusalem-peace-deal-a7797611.html">high-level envoy to the Middle East</a> with no obvious experience in anything but real estate, the state department needs every bit of countervailing expertise it can muster.</p>

<p>On this front, Pham’s paper is a worrying document. It implies that the US’s approach to African conflicts might best be left solely to the Pentagon, a move which would do terrible damage. Abandoning civilian oversight would hollow out the US’s understanding of these highly complex wars and insurgencies. The State Department needs conflict experts more than anything else. As anyone who’s witnessed US foreign policy since 9/11 knows, the causes of war are not addressed by dropping bombs.</p>

<h2>The lie of the land</h2>

<p>Perhaps this is purely academic. After all, when (more likely than if) Pham is appointed, he’ll have little political or budgetary heft to work with. But notwithstanding the diminishment of the State Department in which he may soon be serving, he is undeniably an impressive figure. </p>

<p>Of all the rumoured finalists for the position, he stands head and shoulders above the rest; a Vatican-trained theologian with immense historical knowledge, he worked for the Vatican’s diplomatic service in conflict zones in Africa. He speaks and writes knowledgeably about the crucial importance of northern Nigeria; he is very well connected and well travelled.</p>

<p>If he can use the assistant secretary position to its fullest, he might be better placed than the UK’s new minister of state for Africa, <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201706230948.html">Rory Stewart</a>, a young adventurer who wound up administering much of <a href="http://www.rorystewart.co.uk/looking-back-on-iraq/">Iraq</a> and who went on to philanthropic work in Afghanistan. Unlike his predecessor Tobias Ellwood, who was simultaneously minister for both Africa and the Middle East, Stewart will at least be devoted to Africa – but he will also be split between two ministries, the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. </p>

<p>It seems that on the British side of the Atlantic, Africa is too often still viewed as a single patient in need of foreign remedies rather than a cluster of very different emerging diplomatic and economic players. On that, chalk up at least one preliminary point for Pham in what might end up a sideways-glancing competition between two relatively young men who suddenly find themselves serious world players in the service of equally hapless governments.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80411/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>Italy’s ambassador to the EU <a href="https://www.ansa.it/english/news/2017/06/28/italy-takes-formal-eu-migrant-step-ports-cd-be-blocked-2_5c093f91-a194-4c4f-9cbb-8efb2521a5f5.html">told the EU’s migration commissioner</a> that the situation in the country was “at the limit” and “unsustainable”. Italy’s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/06/28/news/migranti_italia_ue_sbarchi-169383917/">also implored</a> other European countries to stop looking the other way because the situation was “no longer sustainable”. </p>

<p>This is a risky move. Prohibiting rescued migrants from arriving in ports is unlikely to be possible in practice and could go against international law. In the meantime, the political rhetoric is poisoning the way search and rescue at sea is seen in Italy and giving credence to the anti-migrant views of an emboldened far-right. What happens next will be a major test of Europe’s capacity to come up with better ways of responding to migration across the Mediterranean.</p>

<h2>Legal difficulties</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/International-Convention-on-Maritime-Search-and-Rescue-(SAR).aspx">International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue</a>, states and ships have an obligation to go to the assistance of nearby vessels in distress. Following rescue operations there is also an <a href="http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Facilitation/personsrescued/Pages/Default.aspx">obligation that rescued people are taken to safety</a>, regardless of their nationality, status or the circumstances in which they are found. In the Mediterranean this means migrant boats in distress should not be left to sink, nor should they be sent back to Libya, where most of them are now coming from.</p>

<p>In practice, stand offs between migrant boats and the Italian authorities have already happened before. In 1991, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/08/09/albania-and-italy-block-ports/5dd4c235-5f09-4b6c-8ca6-fa9c0e381ccf/">the Vlora</a>, a freighter full of people fleeing Albania, was initially blocked from entering the port of Bari but landed anyway with conditions on board rapidly deteriorating. In 2004, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/12/sudan.italy">the Cap Anamur</a>, a German aid ship, rescued 37 people from a dinghy between Libya and Italy but was stopped from entering Italian ports. After a two-week standoff they were allowed to land when the deteriorating physical and psychological well-being of everyone on board was said to be putting the ship and crew in danger. </p>

<p>These historical stand offs suggest that the current tensions are a bluff – ships are eventually allowed to land. Italy is using the threat to press their European neighbours for increased support.  </p>

<p>So far, however, <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-17-1876_en.htm">an expression of “strong solidarity”</a> on July 3 from the French and German interior ministers has offered little in terms of positive, concrete developments. A code of conduct for NGOs will now be drafted by Italy, despite the fact that Mediterranean search and rescue organisations <a href="https://www.humanrightsatsea.org/?smd_process_download=1&amp;download_id=7061">already have one</a>. The Libyan coastguard will be given increased training and financial support but they’ve proved to be unpredictable partners, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/libyan-coastguard-opens-fire-migrant-boats-ngos-170525100451559.html">shooting at migrants and rescue boats</a>. </p>

<p>Efforts will also be made to improve facilities for migrants in Libya but this is likely to be a slow process as the country remains mired in political chaos and insecurity, with migrants held in <a href="http://globalinitiative.net/report-the-human-conveyor-belt-trends-in-human-trafficking-and-smuggling-in-post-revolution-libya/">crowded, unsanitary and often violent detention centres</a>. In any case, Libyan coastguards and other authorities are also <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/world/2017/07/02/they-are-not-treated-like-humans-inside-libyas-thriving-migrant-trade/?utm_term=.ba5c31055ab3">reported to have</a> links with migrant smuggling. </p>

<p>Italy may also demand that ports of other countries within Europe or nearer to Libya accept rescue boat disembarkations. A stepping up of refugee relocation out of Italy would be welcome too. In September 2015 it was said that 39,600 relocations would take place from Italy within two years. So far, <a href="https://t.co/wlzda4suJL">only 20% of that figure</a> has been achieved and some EU member states have refused to take anyone in at all. </p>

<h2>Blaming NGOs</h2>

<p>The threat to close Italy’s ports also heralds a worrying escalation of anti-NGO rhetoric within the country. For a while now, rescue operations have been presented by critics as a “pull factor” which makes the dangerous journey across the sea appear less risky to migrants. At the end of 2016, the FT <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3e6b6450-c1f7-11e6-9bca-2b93a6856354">reported</a> that Frontx, the EU’s border management agency, had circulated confidential reports claiming that NGOs in the Mediterranean worked in collusion with smugglers. A few months later, a prosecutor in Italy <a href="http://www.lastampa.it/2017/04/23/italia/cronache/abbiamo-le-prove-dei-contatti-tra-scafisti-e-alcuni-soccorritori-3fCnqLKWWRHBVUiygHv65K/pagina.html">publicly claimed</a> that he had evidence of it. </p>

           </blockquote>
          <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Political debate fed off these rumours with increased criticism of search and rescue. In April, Luigi di Maio from the Movimento 5 Stelle (Five Star Movement), deplored what he called <a href="http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/politica/2017/04/23/migranti-di-maio-ong-hanno-trasportato-criminali-_48c4044a-7c54-42a0-ae81-99464536f076.html">a “taxi service”</a> being run by NGOs for illegal migrants. Matteo Salvini of the Lega Nord party which has long held an anti-immigrant stance, followed up by stating that <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/04/30/news/ong_migranti_salvini_dossier-164301374/">Italian secret services had a file</a> recording relationships between smugglers and NGOs. The president of Italy’s parliamentary committee for control of the secret services <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/05/02/la-cei-condanna-gli-attacchi-alle-ong-fuoco-politico-ipocrita_a_22064896/">later denied</a> this. </p>

<p>Despite making public statements about smuggler-NGO collusion, the prosecutor looking into the allegations at the time <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39686239">had also not yet opened a criminal investigation</a>. He later said that he <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2017/04/28/news/carmelo_zuccaro_denuncio_non_ho_prove_sta_ai_politici_fermare_il_fenomeno_-164101452/">did not have enough proof</a>.</p>

<p>But xenophobic far-right groups were emboldened. In May, an organisation known as Generazione Identitaria <a href="https://news.vice.com/it/article/estrema-destra-crowdfunding-per-bloccare-ong">physically blocked an NGO ship</a> from leaving port to carry out operations. It has since started crowdfunding to take its own missions at sea to prevent rescues taking place.  </p>

<p>Critics have been vocal, and if their claims are justified then it is right that investigations are carried out. But so far, evidence has not been presented. A <a href="https://blamingtherescuers.org/">recent research project</a> found that claims of collusion were based on “biased analysis and spurious causality links”. This is supported by research my colleagues and I did for the <a href="http://www.medmig.info">MEDMIG project</a> in 2015, when we found that migration across the Mediterranean towards Italy was driven more by a need to get out of Libya than by the prospect of being rescued. Many of the people we spoke with knew that they could die at sea, but still considered that to be better than staying where they were. </p>



<p>The threat to close ports shows the governing Partito Democratico to be taking <a href="http://www.ansa.it/english/news/world/2017/06/28/renzi-backs-govt-hard-line-on-migrants_08258469-3f8d-41c7-a59f-a81c208cf471.html">a harder line in its rhetoric on migration</a>. It follows <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/italy-election-result-berlusconi-led-center-right-scores-upset-wins/">disappointing local elections</a> in late June, and a more vocal anti-migrant stance from the Movimento 5 Stelle’s <a href="https://theconversation.com/rome-mayors-anti-migrant-stance-signals-shift-further-to-right-for-italys-five-star-movement-79529">mayor of Rome</a>.</p>

<p>But the government is also undermining humanitarian work at sea without finding an effective replacement. As <a href="http://msf-analysis.org/bounties-not-bodies-smugglers-profit-sea-rescues-though-no-clear-alternative-available/">noted</a> by Aurelie Ponthieu, a humanitarian specialist on displacement at Medecins Sans Frontieres, search and rescue at sea is not perfect and cannot go on indefinitely. But for now, Europe’s proposals lack a clear, decent long-term alternative to letting people drown.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80428/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

According to <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/06/13/how-britain-voted-2017-general-election/">YouGov’s national data</a>, some 64% of students voted for the Labour party compared to only 19% for the Conservatives.</p>

<p>Surveys of this kind give a good impression of the national distribution of student votes. However, there is little detailed evidence about students’ voting preferences and how these have changed over time. But a recent discovery at the University of Exeter, our own institution, provided a rare opportunity to do just that – at least at the local level. </p>

<p>In 1979, Exeter’s politics department conducted a survey of the university’s students about the election in May of that year. We found a copy of the research produced from that survey in the university library. This document, as well as the preservation of the original data by the UK Data Service, allowed us to repeat the survey this year for the 2017 election. </p>

<p>These two surveys, conducted 38 years apart, offer an insight into the changing student vote at Exeter. They capture a shift from a campus that largely supported the Conservatives to one backing Labour.</p>

<p>Exeter has long had an anecdotal reputation as a bastion for student Conservatism. Several prominent Conservative political figures are Exeter alumni, including the communities secretary Sajid Javid and Tim Montgomerie, former editor of <a href="http://www.conservativehome.com/">ConservativeHome</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, the paper produced after the 1979 survey described the campus as “a haven for those from public schools and higher social groups”. Yet while this may have led to more votes for the Conservatives at Exeter in the past, our new survey shows that this is no longer the case.</p>

<h2>Shifting support</h2>

<p>In 1979 the Conservative party won the Exeter student vote by a wide margin, with an absolute majority of 56.4%. Labour was in third place on only 15.4%, behind the Liberal party on 21.4%.</p>

<p>By 2017, the situation had completely changed. We found that it was instead the Labour party which won a landslide at Exeter, garnering 59.2% of the vote against the Conservatives on 20.9%. The Liberal Democrats took just 14.4% of the vote. </p>

<p>A large part of this shift appears to have occurred very recently. When we asked our 2017 respondents how they had voted in 2015, Labour was not dominant at Exeter. In fact, the Conservatives narrowly won the vote. This in an election in which Labour won 18 24-year-olds by about <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/how-britain-voted-2015">16% points nationwide</a>. Exeter’s Conservative image may therefore have held at least in part until quite recently.</p>

            </figcaption>
          </figure></p>

<p>The surveys also contained a number of questions which offer some insight into why this shift has occurred.</p>

<p>The Labour vote appears to be unrelated to the family backgrounds of modern Exeter students. In 1979, students overwhelmingly reported that their parents were also Conservative voters. In 2017, while a greater share of parents were now Labour voters, the Conservatives were still the plurality choice among Exeter parents.</p>

<p>Our survey also showed that although most students voting Labour expressed confidence in Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, they were less enthusiastic about aspects of the Labour manifesto – including <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-govenrment-trade-union-general-election-legislation-repeal-conservatives-bill-a7698596.html">relaxing restrictions on trade unions</a> and <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/right-buy-scrapped-temporarily-labour-8911648">stopping the sale of council houses</a>.</p>

<p>The decline of student Conservatism at Exeter seemed primarily related to other factors. Labour was particularly successful among women, for example. This reversed the pattern shown in the 1979 survey, in which the Conservatives were significantly ahead with women.</p>

<p>The Labour campaign also appears to have been quite effective. Labour voters on average decided later than Conservatives during the campaign, and Labour dominated among the most active users of political social media – in particular on Twitter.</p>

<p>However, the most significant factor appeared to be the 2016 EU referendum. Brexit split the country but united students, with <a href="https://www.youthsight.com/ys-news-open-britain-poll-students-brexit-regret/">84% backing Remain nationally</a>. Likewise, according to our data, Exeter students voted 79% to 13.2% to remain, including 75.4% of those who had voted Conservative in 2015. Consequently, almost half (48.6%) of the Exeter students who voted Conservative in 2015 had switched to Labour or the Liberal Democrats in 2017.</p>

<p>While our survey only shows a small part of the national picture in terms student voting, it demonstrates clearly the damage done to the Conservative brand among students, even at institutions at which the party has traditionally done well. To win back student voters, the Conservative party must find a way to repair the damage done by Brexit. If it fails, it risks losing a generation of educated young people, and particularly young women, who might otherwise have formed the next generation of Conservative candidates, activists and voters.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80235/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>Her original conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeal because they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/12/gayle-newland-sentenced-eight-years-prison-duping-friend-having-sex">found it “unsafe”</a> due to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-37632913">the trial judge’s summing up</a>. Her conviction is the latest in a spate of recent prosecutions brought against young LGBTQ people for gender identity fraud: <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/agony-of-teen-victims-of-gemma-barker-752654">Gemma Barker</a> in 2012; <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9946687/18-year-old-woman-masqueraded-as-boy-to-get-girl-into-bed.html">Justine McNally</a> in 2013; <a href="http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/man-%E2%80%98guilty%E2%80%99-fraud-not-telling-girlfriend-he-was-trans070313/">Chris Wilson</a> in 2013; Gayle Newland in 2015; <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/15/woman-who-used-fake-penis-to-have-sex-with-a-woman-avoids-jail">Kyran Lee (Mason)</a>, in 2015; and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/woman-posed-as-man-to-have-sex-teenage-girls-jennifer-staines-bristol-a6948491.html">Jason Staines</a> in 2016. All of these resulted in conviction, sex offender registration and, typically, a custodial sentence.</p>

<p>In my view, prosecutions of this kind should not be started. </p>

<p>My reasons include that it is an overreach of criminal law (the criminalisation of non-coercive, desire-led intimacy is a step too far), and concern over legal inconsistency – contrast the prosecution of gender non-conforming people for sexual fraud with the fact that deceptions as to wealth, social status, drug use, criminal convictions, religious belief and/or ethnic status produce no legal consequences in the UK. Then there is discrimination: “gender history” is not only singled out for special legal attention, but it is the gender histories of young LGBTQ people, rather than people in general that appears to exhaust state interest in historical facts about gender.</p>

<p>And in the case of trans defendants, concern over the ease with which non-consent has been established despite the lack of a gap between a complainant’s belief about a lover’s gender identity and their actual gender identity.</p>

<h2>The ‘privilege of unknowing’</h2>

<p>I want to focus on Newland because the case allows for a more nuanced discussion of how we might think about consent in such cases. It might be thought that consent was clearly lacking in this deception case because of an obvious deficit between the complainant’s belief and the defendant’s actual gender identity. That is, the complainant believed the defendant to be a man, and she is not. However, and while two juries found the complainant to be ignorant of Newland’s gender identity, we should not necessarily equate “ignorance” with non-consent.   </p>

<p>Specifically, I want to raise the possibility that complainant truth might, at least in part, be founded on what queer scholar, Eve Sedgwick, <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/tendencies">described as</a> the “privilege of unknowing”. This phrase serves to problematise a clear distinction between ignorance and knowledge. Sedgwick is referring to a cultural and psychological process whereby privileged onlookers learn not to see, or otherwise sense, queer difference. In other words, complainant truth might not easily be disentangled from forms of “learned unknowing” that operate within a hetero and cisnormative society (one which privileges the majority of people who conform to their birth gender and to normative gender expectations). </p>

<p>Think of the scene in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104036/">Crying Game</a> where the main protagonist Fergus visits a queer bar, the Metro. As the camera pans the room, it is obvious that practically everybody in the bar is LGBTQ. Yet, Fergus fails to see what is plainly in view. He is not looking for it, not expecting it, for him it is simply not there. And, of course, privileged unknowingness can affect all the senses. In the context of sexual intimacy (the enmeshing of bodies), the difference between ignorance and knowledge might be thought of as one between imagining a lover’s body and an experience of it. That is, we might think of ignorance as disavowal, a repudiation of the senses. </p>

<p>In the Newland case, the complainant admitted having sex with Newland on at least ten occasions and spending more than 100 hours in her company, sometimes at the complainant’s apartment, sometimes at a local hotel. Her ignorance regarding Newland’s gender identity was apparently due to a blindfold worn on all occasions at Newland’s request (Newland, who identifies as lesbian, disputed both of these claims). The complainant’s other senses, apparently, also deserted her. Thus her sense of touch proved insensitive to the contours and smooth surface of Newland’s body, and to the prosthetic penis which Newland used, while her sense of hearing proved impervious to Newland’s voice which falls within the female range. </p>

<p>Yet, if we do not see our lover’s face, do we not sense them in other ways? Do we not breath them in, feel their touch, become acquainted with their smell, experience the contours of their body, feel their breath upon our skin, the timbre of their voice? And are we not undone in such moments, irrespective of the evidence before us? Is it right in such circumstances to conclude that consent is absent? If we are to take seriously feminist notions of agency, how can we claim not to have consented to lesbian sex when the presence of a female lover has taken the form of sensory overload? </p>

<p>And if our bodies yield in such encounters (perhaps we are even transported), is it right to disown our desires because we are retrospectively disappointed? Is it appropriate to refuse to acknowledge embodied experiences, apparently at odds with our desires, and the pleasures we derive from them, to refuse to acknowledge information that arrives through our senses, calling us to respond, and to which we do respond? </p>

<p>These are admittedly, difficult and discomforting questions. No doubt, there will be those who prefer not to ask them. Yet, difficult though such conversations may be, they are perhaps where ethics begins, that is, the forging of an ethical relation between <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/09/cisgenders-linguistic-uphill-battle/380342/">cisgender</a> people and the trans and/or queer lovers to whom they are attracted.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80407/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

According to this popular narrative, the votes of millions of young people were responsible for Labour’s surprisingly strong showing and the accompanying failure of the Conservatives to secure a widely anticipated majority government. The story has much to recommend it.</p>

<p>Data gathered in our Essex Continuous Monitoring Survey (ECMS) show that 63% of voters between 18 and 29 voted Labour. That dropped to just 23% for voters over 65.</p>

<p>This pattern, also documented in other post-election surveys, is important because turnout among young people in 2017 was much greater than in had been in the preceding general election in 2015. Our estimates indicate that only 42% of those under 30 voted in 2015 but that 61% did in 2017. The turnout surge among the young had a major payoff for Labour. The probability that Labour would win a constituency (expressed from 0 to 1 with 1 representing a certainty) climbed from 0.10 to 0.69 as the percentage of residents in the constituency under 30 increased. In contrast, the probability that the Conservatives would win fell from 0.89 to only 0.07. Labour clearly benefited handsomely from young people’s support in 2017.</p>

<p>Why did youth rally so strongly to Labour? Evidence from our ECMS pre- and post-election surveys helps answer this question. Some observers have speculated that young people were attracted to Labour on the issues, especially Brexit and education. We do <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/brexit-why-britain-voted-leave-european-union#qxq6CvRXIMZu628C.97">know</a> that a large majority of young people voted Remain in the EU referendum. Labour’s election manifesto pledge to abolish university tuition fees presumably also had a powerful appeal among youth.</p>

<p>The ECMS survey shows that those under 30 years of age were indeed more likely than older people to mention education as one of the top three most important issues to them. But that’s not to say an overwhelming majority of them did so. In fact, only 23% of them cited education in their top three. And the percentage citing <a href="https://theconversation.com/uk/eu-referendum-2016">Brexit</a> as a top three issue was actually greater among older people than younger ones. </p>

<p>More generally, except for immigration and the environment, the mix of issues identified as especially important was quite similar across all age categories, with Brexit and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/uk/topics/nhs-5512">NHS</a> being the most widely cited by all groups. And, no matter what issue was at the top of their list, young people tended to think Labour was best able to handle it.</p>

<p>A second explanation for Labour’s appeal among young people concerns party leaders. Leader images have strong effects on voters and the ECMS data reveal that Jeremy Corbyn was much more warmly received among young people than Theresa May. The percentage of ECMS respondents scoring Corbyn 6 or more on a 0 (dislike) to 10 (like) scale falls from 58% among those under 30 to 24% among those 65 or older.</p>

<p>Similar patterns emerge when voters were asked about leaders’ traits. Young people were much more likely than older ones to see Corbyn as competent, caring, trustworthy and strong. Young people also were much more likely to have negative perceptions of May’s leadership traits and to indicate that they did not regard her positively.  Echoing Bernie Sander’s strong appeal among young people in the Democratic primaries in the 2016 US presidential election, Corbyn’s appeal to British youth was massive in 2017.</p>

<p>The importance of these patterns is confirmed when we conduct statistical analyses that control for a wide range of factors affecting voting. As is typical in such analyses, judgements about party performance on key issues and images of the party leaders have very strong effects on voters’ decisions to opt for Labour versus the Conservatives. And as we’ve seen, issue judgements and leader images differed widely across age groups in 2017, giving Labour a strong advantage among young people.</p>

<p>In fully 34,944 separate analyses with controls for several predictors traditionally used in voting studies (partisanship, education, gender, country/region of residence and social class) membership in the 18 to 29 age group always has a significant direct or indirect effect on the likelihood of voting Labour. The party’s appeal to youth in 2017 was powerful and multifaceted.</p>

<h2>Labour for life?</h2>

<p>Relationships between age and voting behaviour at any point in time are ambiguous. It may be that we are witnessing the emergence of distinct “political generation” and, as they age, today’s youth will continue to support Labour strongly in future elections. However, it may be that Labour’s youthquake was what social scientists call a “period effect” specific to the 2017 election. </p>

<p>Although we cannot be sure, there is circumstantial evidence in favour of the latter interpretation. Most of the 18 to 29-year-olds analysed here were eligible to vote in the 2015 general election. As observed above, far fewer of them went to the polls and, of those that did, only 37% voted Labour. The party’s attractiveness to young people changed markedly in only two years.</p>

<p>Why? Numerous observers have emphasised the sharp contrast in the campaigns mounted by two major parties in 2017. Labour’s campaign was characterised by appealing manifesto pledges, positive packaging and innovative social media techniques for reaching voters – particularly young people. Corbyn showed that he was an adept retail politician, capable of parrying Conservative attacks on his competence and character with surprising ease.</p>

<p>In sharp contrast, the Conservatives’ manifesto has been widely criticised as a “dark document” that did little to excite young people while frightening their elders with widely publicised threats of dementia taxes and other public service cutbacks. For her part, May demonstrated precious little aptitude for electioneering and failed to make a convincing case that she would provide “strong and stable” leadership as the head of a Conservative majority government. </p>

<p>In the end, the two parties’ contrasting campaigns helped to resurrect the Conservatives’ reputation as “the nasty party” – a term May herself had famously coined 15 years earlier as she appealed to Conservatives to adopt a warmer image. In 2017, it did much to weaken her party’s appeal to a restive electorate fatigued by years of austerity and ready for change.

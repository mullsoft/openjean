<p>Depending on how well you write and how often you publish or change jobs or assignments, other writers come in and out of your life. Some of them are already famous and others will be soon, but celebrity doesn’t matter because you know something together—the private thrill that comes from writing a clear and unique sentence. The craft of it. James Salter liked to “rub words in his hand, to turn them around and feel them.”</p>
<p>Writing is exactly that, and there is no work like it because it is so complicated to know when you are done. Riffing about writing journalism, Renata Adler wrote, in her novel <em>Speedboat, </em>about giving “a piece of sugar to a raccoon, which in its odd fastidiousness would wash that sugar in a brook till there was nothing left.”  Editors can help with that.</p>
<p>Before I became an editor I had an intuition about what readers wanted: they wanted to read whatever I wanted to write. Sure they did. I just needed a little editing sometimes. Every editor I ever had, including the bad ones, were strict about pieces living or dying by their language—even if they couldn’t write themselves, which of course they couldn’t. That’s why they were editors. Or so I thought until I met the editor who made me an editor.</p>
<p>His name was Bob Sherrill, and at 41, he was known in the magazine world to be at once crazy and shrewd and kind. He was said to be especially good with young writers, and was also known for out-dressing them in his white high-top Chuck Taylors with the fluorescent red laces (untied), his baggy blue-and-white seersucker suits and his black T-shirts, a green-and-pink silk bandanna around his neck and a Black Watch beret over his shaggy strawberry blond hair. Plus his Ray-Bans, rain or shine. Bob was colorful.</p>
<span class="pullquote">“Before Microsoft Word, stopping to count how many words you’d typed could be refreshing, like stopping to make tea or smoke a cigarette.”</span>
<p>He was also a bit surreal, a flipped-out literary ice-cream man, but handsome too, and women liked him—I worked for him as a reporter at a start-up weekly called <em>LA </em>that we were saying was like, you know, “the <em>Village Voice, </em>but for Los Angeles.” Bob never said that, though. He had come west on an “editorial whim” (his phrase) after some turbulent years in New York at <em>Esquire, </em>where he had “just tried to be helpful” (ditto) with that genre-cracking run of pieces that defined the New Journalism. Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, Truman Capote, Norman Mailer—every writer in the country knew the growing roll call. Bob had edited all of them and liked to talk about how they got their story ideas.</p>
<p>“From editors, of course,” he would say, riding shotgun with a Mexican beer between his knees, motoring around Southern California with one or another of the young writers who worked for him. Bob would never let you use <em>eventful </em>in a piece but this particular day was that for me, driving us both down the coast to a party in Dana Point where there would be journalists, maybe a couple novelists, and also people in the new MFA program at UC Irvine.</p>
<p>I knew Bob would be the center of the party as he always was wherever writers and alcohol came together. All the way down the Pacific Coast Highway we talked story ideas. Bob was warming up for the writers who would soon be circling for a chance to talk to him, all of them wanting to break trail for an assignment from <em>Esquire, </em>where he was still a contributing editor. Somewhere near Laguna Beach I said something about how anybody interested in journalism (like me) would want to read a piece about Bob himself, and what was about to happen to him at the party.</p>
<p>Bob had a way of cocking his head when he got a new idea. That’s what he did then, and told me <em>he </em>thought <em>I </em>thought like an editor and we should <em>both </em>think about <em>that. </em>Think about me becoming an editor. “Think about monkeys jumping out of boxes,” he said. “That’s what good editors do.” I had not heard that one but figured he was talking about jack-in-the-box surprises. I nodded. He cocked his head again. I waited.</p>
<p>“Plus,” he said, taking another pull from his Tecate, “good editors never have to drive. You just have to be helpful.”</p>
<p>I was far from imagining I would ever become what I thought of as a real editor, like Sherrill, let alone work at his hallowed <em>Esquire, </em>or edit Wolfe, Talese and Mailer. But that’s what happened, and I met new writers and worked with them and picked up some editing tricks that seemed to amuse them.</p>
<p>Here’s one: There is a word count at the top of this column because as an editor I always wanted to know how far my pencil would have to travel. This helped me evaluate pacing or the lack of it. Writers were sensitive to this once they found out how I worked, even if they weren’t being paid by the word.</p>
<p>At all the magazines I edited (<em>Rolling Stone</em>, <em>Esquire</em>, <em>Sports Illustrated</em>, et al.), features were assigned at a specific length—usually 4,000 words—and most writers would take that over 3,000 and say they were close. Others would come in under 3,000 and say the same thing. It was mysterious why being direct about the number of words they were filing was so difficult but I am sure it had more to do with some kind of alchemy than lack of discipline. Before Microsoft Word, stopping to count how many words you’d typed could be refreshing, like stopping to make tea or smoke a cigarette. Now doing a word count can have a slot machine kick to it if you have the discipline not to do it every time you hit <em>save</em>.</p>
<p>None of this matters if the piece is good—and that’s determined by voice and narrative, not length. Going long is always more ambitious and usually more fun. This was true before lengthy pieces became “creative nonfiction” or “narrative journalism,” and it’s true now that we’ve finally debunked the simple-minded web assumption that no one will screen-read anything longer than a news capsule. No writer I ever edited wanted to go short, anyway. Neither do I, but I also know that the best pieces seem to find their own length. That’s the alchemy, and I will have more to say about it in upcoming columns on Lit Hub.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can be helpful.</p>

The last aisle on the left before the magazines. Top shelf between social studies and psychology: just as the social studies books began to bleed into psychology, there was for the span of a few book spines, a zone of titles that were neither psychology or sociology. This unmarked, nebulous space was the queer section. Things that could be found there: a single copy of a best gay erotica anthology, a couple erotic novels, one or two manga, a coffee table book of artful nudes, and maybe a book about lesbians, depending on the day.</p>
<p>When I was in my late teens, I went to the bookstore to buy a copy of <em>Giovanni’s Room</em>, which I had discovered on some online list of gay novels. It wasn’t under fiction, so I thought to check the queer section, but it wasn’t there either. I went to find a clerk. “We don’t keep <em>that</em> in the store,” is what he said to me. I still remember the sweat gathering in his mustache as he said it, his eyes narrowing. I asked him about some other titles, and title for title, he said it over and over, “We don’t carry <em>that</em>. You have to get <em>that</em> online.” Not even an <em>I’m sorry</em> to soften the blow of it, just a flat denial and a tone of voice that told me I should be ashamed.</p>
<p>In an essay titled “To Suffer or Disappear: The State of Queer Literary Fiction,” Michelle Hart asks:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">What does it say about the state of queer fiction that its biggest success is a book written by a straight woman that essentially suggests gay men can either be yuppies or victims of sexual abuse—or you know, both. There seems to be no in between when it comes to queer characters, male or female. We’re either just like them or we suffer greatly because we’re not like them.</p>
<p>The book referenced above is Hanya Yanagihara’s <em>A Little Life</em>, hailed by Garth Greenwell as The Great Gay Novel in the pages of <em>The Atlantic</em>. I remember all the fanfare surrounding <em>A Little Life. </em>For the first time, it seemed to me then, queer lives were being treated as a worthy subject for art. Not merely for queer people, but for straight people too. If I could visit any literary website and find a review or rumination on <em>A Little Life,</em> then it felt to me like <em>we</em> had finally <em>made it!</em> This was some years after I had been rebuffed in that Books-A-Million in Alabama, and it seemed like we were finally turning a corner. We were mainstream, at last. But I also remember thinking how predictable it was that a book all about queer people suffering was being adulated by straight people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="pullquote">“Who wanted to read about coming out or AIDS or getting gay-bashed? Where were the stories about queer bucolic malaise?”</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how cultural selection works when one inhabits a culture within an overculture. The larger culture selects the narratives that are the most readily translated into terms it deems legible. Shame, pain, and an intense desire to assimilate are the most legible aspects of queer life as perceived by the heteronormative overculture. Therefore, the art that it chooses to endorse often slots neatly into those categories. The coming-out story, violence against queer bodies, queer sexuality, the recapitulation of heteronormative family structures—all of these narratives position queer lives as either a simulacrum or an antithesis of straight lives.</p>
<p>But I think we need to recast this question of successful queer narratives entirely, and to delegitimize the overcultural gaze. That is: who cares what straight people think? Why is their approval the standard by which we measure the success of queer narratives? This is a problem that goes beyond which books are hailed in mainstream literary publications and stabs directly at the heart of power. It is a question of whose stories get to inhabit narrative space as legitimate and worthy, and whose stories do not.</p>
<p>In our current aesthetic framework, queerness is a charged state—it has the effect of reconfiguring the context of everything it touches such that those objects become activated with meaning. When a character is queer in a story, there is an expectation on the part of the reader that their queerness should enter into things in some way, that there must be a reason that a character has been charged in this way, or else why has the author gone through the trouble of designating them as such?</p>
<p>Queerness, unlike heterosexuality or whiteness or being able-bodied, is not a neutral state, and as such seems to command some contextualizing energy in order to justify its presence within narrative spaces. One must do work in order to explain why a character is queer or else it is seen as an extraneous fact, a superfluous detail, a distraction. I have been in many workshops where I have been asked to provide background information to explain how it is possible for a person to be attracted to both men and women, that if a character has only slept with women but finds themselves involved with a man, that there has been some mistake in the writing of this, that their sexuality has come as a sudden and startling surprise. The underlying assumption is that any deviation from the experience of a presumed white, cis, heterosexual, neurotypical person of some means is seen as an undue tax upon the reader’s empathy and worse still, some kind of indulgent idiosyncratic quirk on the part of the writer—avarice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="pullquote">“Who cares what straight people think? Why is their approval the standard by which we measure the success of queer narratives?”</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was just beginning to write stories, a guy I liked at the time asked me, “When are you going to write about straight people?” Another friend of mine asked, “When are you going to stop writing about relationships?” These questions hounded me. I found myself unable to write anything at all. I knew that I wanted to write good stories. I knew that I wanted to write about queer people. I wanted to put down our experiences in a way that felt organic and real and true. But in workshop, these two motivations felt at odds with each other. It felt that there was nothing worse than writing <em>issue fiction</em> or writing in a way that felt charged. As it was conveyed to me, the highest virtue in art was a simulation of the colorless, genderless white heterosexuality insisted upon by my peers, and if I was to become a good writer, I would have to make my stories as transparent as glass, as devoid of the charge of queerness as possible. I would need to write away from the legibly queer or else, directly into its tropes. I felt trapped. It felt impossible.</p>
<p>In a 1990 interview with Bill Moyers, Toni Morrison was asked the question of whether or not she could conceive of writing a novel that wasn’t about black people. The exchange is excerpted below:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">BILL MOYERS: I don’t mean this to be a trick question, it just occurs to me, though, is it conceivable that you could write a novel in which blacks are not center stage?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">TONI MORRISON: Absolutely.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">BILL MOYERS: You think the public would let you, because the expectations are you made such a&#8230; you’ve achieved such fame and made such a contribution by writing about black people in your novel that they now expect you to write about black people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">TONI MORRISON: I will, but I won’t identify them as such. That’s the difference. […]</p>
<p>The eye cannot gaze backward at itself. The place from which the gaze originates is the center. When blackness is taken as a given, as the prevailing state of the story, there is no need to designate, categorize, call attention to it. When one writes of blackness in direct terms, in the most basic terminology of hue and color and tone, then one is acknowledging one’s place embedded within a larger, whiter framework. But when you stake blackness at the center of a story and hold it constant and steady, then there is no need to contextualize, neutralize its charge.</p>
<p>My friends and I often exchange movie recommendations—movies because my friends aren’t especially bookish and prefer film and television to novels or short stories—and for a long time our group chat was just a string of links to various trailers or streaming sites. Almost without exception, the films we recommended to each other were about queer people, specifically gay men.</p>
<p>We watched them all: <em>Weekend, Shelter, August, Free Fall, Rock Haven, Boys, Brokeback Mountain, Come Undone, A Question of Love, Love Songs. </em>The films I favored were the slate-toned French films prone to melancholy and to long, slow scenes unfolding on trains, or the quietly frustrated claustrophobia of seaside homes in Normandy. I was drawn to films where the majority of the energy was subterranean, powering subtle variations in facial expressions and voice. I was in love with the way that French boys suffered and how their suffering was of a piece with their daily lives—in French queer film, that which is unbearable is not a distinct, queer register but hums throughout the whole of a life, as derived from the cruelty of family as from queerness itself. I wanted to write these kinds of stories because they were about queer people but not about being queer, and that was how I thought fiction should work. What use did I have for stories about queerness, those had all been told. Who wanted to read about coming out or AIDS or getting gay-bashed? Where were the stories about queer bucolic malaise? That’s what I wanted, a purity of aesthetic, a queer neutrality derived from a central queer experience.</p>
<p>It is tempting to imagine that this is the way things ought to be, tasteful meditations on the human condition with queer people at their center, that the supposition of a queer default means an abandonment of trauma narratives and queer suffering. That everything will be alright when we’re finally writing of ourselves in our everyday lives, everything smooth and bourgeois and immaculately styled.</p>
<p>But that would be a grave miscalculation, a failure to understand the fundamental nature of the problem at hand. Queer people live their everyday lives under the threat of violence and political persecution. Queer teens would rather die than continue living in a world that is actively hostile to them. Our narratives must remain alive and vital to that pain, to the very real suffering we endure. To assume a central queer gaze is not to pass judgement on narratives of queer suffering at all, but to allow queer people to continue to tell their stories, to write into their own narrative spaces without the need for a heteronormative overculture. After all, it is the heteronormative gaze that renders these narratives problematic. It is their place of prominence in the overculture that presents the problem, not the narratives themselves.</p>
<p>It is not enough to merely write queers in comfortable bourgeois captivity. You have not conquered some artistic challenge. You are not artistically pure for turning away from queer suffering. Our comfort and our agony are of a piece. They reflect one another across the length of our experience. The answer to Michelle Hart’s question about the state of gay literary fiction is this: we must move toward a queer aesthetic, which permits the true simultaneity of queer experience. We must stop waiting for permission. We must stop looking to the overculture for legitimacy. Within a queer aesthetic, we weep and we laugh and we withdraw and we advance. Queer suffering and queer joy dominate the ordinary instant. We are everything at once.</p>

The first-greatest, of course, is to shoot them now, while they’re happy.&#8221; It&#8217;s rare to see a Parker quip-compliment, so I don&#8217;t take it lightly. But today, 118 years after the birth of E.B. White, and some 18 years after I first encountered his classic style guide (originally written by William Strunk Jr. in 1918—this is getting spooky—but much expanded by White), it&#8217;s time to admit that it&#8217;s not all it&#8217;s cracked up to be.</p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, there is a lot of important information in <em>The Elements of Style</em>. The very first rule, &#8220;form the possessive singular of nouns with &#8216;s,&#8221; for instance, is still necessary and oft-unheeded. Much of the following advice is also useful. Revise and rewrite. Use orthodox spelling. Do not use dialect unless your ear is good. &#8220;Start sniffing the air, or glancing at the Trend Machine, and you are as good as dead, although you may make a nice living.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am not the first writer to suggest that the book <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/50-Years-of-Stupid-Grammar/25497">has some problems</a>. But even in 2017, <em>The Elements of Style</em> occupies a pride of place in the canon of literary how-to manuals, with many teachers holding it up Bible-ishly, and with many students following it to the letter. Some may swear by it, but let&#8217;s be clear: this book is not the be-all-end-all, especially for literary writers. I recognize that this guide is not aimed at professional writers, but rather beginning writing students, many of whom <em>do</em> in fact need to be told that clarity is king—but still, rules learned early on can be tough to shake, and almost all of us learned, at least a little, on Strunk &amp; White.</p>
<p>I have the typical qualm with a lot of the advice—<em>don&#8217;t use active voice, paragraphs should be more than one sentence, place yourself in the background, avoid foreign language</em>s—the typical qualm being, of course: <em>well, not always</em>. Personally I quite like the passive voice. Paragraph-long (and even page-long) sentences can be fantastic. Nabokov&#8217;s novels are full of foreign languages, and if Nabokov did it, it can&#8217;t be wrong. But one can generally assume that any given &#8220;rule&#8221; or piece of advice comes with a &#8220;not always,&#8221; so I won&#8217;t go through all of these one by one. Instead, I&#8217;ll just highlight a few that I find particularly annoying.</p>
<p>First off, we have Rule Sixteen. Rule Sixteen implores the writer to &#8220;prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract.&#8221; The book presents two examples, the first, in each, being &#8220;wrong&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A period of unfavorable weather set in.<br />
vs.<br />
It rained every day for a week.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">and</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well-earned reward.<br />
vs.<br />
He grinned as he pocketed the coin.</p>
<p>I see what they&#8217;re saying there, but I actually prefer &#8220;a period of unfavorable weather set in,&#8221; if only because it&#8217;s less usual and banal—and I think the <em>sense</em> of it is actually quite different than &#8220;it rained every day for a week.&#8221; It&#8217;s an atmospheric statement as opposed to a literal one, and at least to this reader, it is much more evocative. But in any case, the rule goes on:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">If those who have studied the art of writing are in accord on any one point, it is this: the surest way to arouse and hold the readers attention is by being specific, definite, and concrete. The greatest writers—Homer, Dante, Shakespeare—are effective largely because they deal in particulars and report the details that matter. Their words call up pictures.</p>
<p>Well, as one who has studied the art of writing, we are certainly not in accord. By no means do I think any of those three writers are <em>primarily</em> effective because of their &#8220;definite, specific, concrete language.&#8221; Shakespeare may report the details that matter (whatever that means), but his work is full of elaborate wordplay, extended metaphors, ellipses and poetic interludes, and even if it weren&#8217;t, he&#8217;d still have a lot more going for him than concrete sentences.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t take my word for it. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/upshot/the-word-choices-that-explain-why-jane-austen-endures.html?_r=0">recent piece in <em>the New York Times</em></a> attempted to explain Jane Austen&#8217;s enduring popularity by unpacking her word choices; the authors found the language in her six novels to be more abstract than concrete (or &#8220;physical&#8221;) and more quotidian (that is, referring to &#8220;emotions and time&#8221;) than dramatic (&#8220;Medieval stuff&#8221;). The authors describe Austen&#8217;s place on the chart as &#8220;related to a higher-than-average propensity for words like <em>quite, really</em> and <em>very—</em>the sort that writers are urged to avoid if they want muscular prose. It also connects to time markers and states of mind: <em>always, fortnight </em>and<em> week;</em><em> awkward, decided, dislike, glad, sorry, suppose</em>.&#8221; So we are to avoid the very language that has made Jane Austen one of the most beloved writers of all time?</p>
<p>Actually, this study also flies in the face of another of the style guide&#8217;s dictums: Avoid the use of qualifiers. &#8220;<em>Rather, very, little, pretty</em>—these are the leeches that infest the pond of prose, sucking the blood of words,&#8221; says White. And yet, the authors of the aforementioned article noted that &#8220;Austen used intensifying words—like <em>very, much, so</em>—at a higher rate than other writers. The study linked this intensifier use to a crucial trait of her writing, one that might at first seem to resist quantification: irony.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not to say that White&#8217;s suggestions are without merit, only that the presence of such a major counter-example seems to suggest that there is nothing hard nor fast about these rules.</p>
<p>Next, there&#8217;s the infamous rule seventeen: <em>Omit needless words. </em>That is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all sentences short, or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure my hesitation with this one is obvious. What about David Foster Wallace, or Woolf, or Proust, or any other writer of elaborate prose whose work might, under a strict editor following these guidelines, have been unfairly diminished? Maybe you think <em>Infinite Jest </em>could have used a cut or two, but surely you can&#8217;t accuse it of being anything less than <em>vigorous</em>. &#8220;Rich, ornate prose is hard to digest, generally unwholesome, and sometimes nauseating,&#8221; White writes. <em>Unwholesome</em>! How bizarrely moralistic and patently false. Whether it is nauseating to him, of course, is his business; this is merely a matter of taste—which gets at the crux of my argument here. None of these rules apply to everyone, so presenting them in this way is somewhat disingenuous. And in White&#8217;s case, more than somewhat crotchety.</p>
<p>Speaking of elaborate prose, in the book&#8217;s final section, &#8220;An Approach to Style,&#8221; White cautions,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Young writers often suppose that style is a garnish for the meat of prose, a sauce by which a dull dish is made palatable. Style has no such separate entity; it is nondetachable, unfilterable. The beginner should approach style warily, realizing that it is an expression of self, and should turn resolutely away from all devices that are popularly believed to indicate style—all mannerisms, tricks, adornments. The approach to style is by way of plainness, simplicity, orderliness, sincerity.</p>
<p>Of course, it is true that in good writing, style cannot be separated from content—form doesn&#8217;t follow function in literature; form <em>is</em> function, and function form. But here we have two essential arguments for how to approach style, neither of which I find wholly satisfying: one is <em>be yourself</em> (&#8220;it is an expression of self&#8221;) and the other is <em>be plain</em> (&#8220;plainness, simplicity, orderliness, sincerity&#8221;). First of all, what if you are essentially not plain? Surely, James Joyce&#8217;s mannerisms, tricks, and adornments were sincere enough. Secondly, is style really so nebulous and unruly that it must be approached warily? Is it not something that can be developed and used—for adornment or unadornment—like the tool that it is? If not, then why write a whole book about it?</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the final &#8220;reminder&#8221; of the book: &#8220;Prefer the standard to the offbeat.&#8221; White primarily uses this section to argue against adopting language from business and advertising, and whatever other lingo the kids are throwing around these days (<em>psyched</em>, <em>nerd</em>, <em>ripoff</em>, <em>dude</em>, <em>geek</em>, and <em>funky</em> are words he expects are already out of date, but other than <em>funky</em> . . .). He&#8217;s careful not to completely discount irregular prose, but writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The intent is to suggest that in choosing between the formal and the informal, the regular and the offbeat, the general and the special, the orthodox and the heretical, the beginner err on the side of conservatism, on the side of established usage. No idiom is taboo, no accent forbidden; there is simply a better chance of doing well if the writer holds a steady course, enters the stream of English quietly, and does not thrash about.</p>
<p>Which I understand. As a writing teacher, I know that most people need to master the rules before they can break them. But as a reader, I love to see the thrashing. I almost <em>always</em> prefer the offbeat to the standard—in word choice, in subject matter, in structure. Even in beginning writers, who haven&#8217;t had the nonsense knocked out of them yet, and who still have a chance to be wildly themselves. But again, that&#8217;s my personal preference. I suppose I am simply arguing that there is no writing guide that can actually teach you style with any skill.

<p>On a cold Monday night in January, we were at <a href="http://www.stillwatersinastorm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Still Waters in a Storm</a>, the “one-room schoolhouse” learning sanctuary for immigrant children opened by Stephen ten years ago in this former storefront on Stanhope Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn—Stephen is Still Waters’ director and only fulltime teacher. He was telling me about their new Don Quixote Project, which he sees as lasting five years. Over those years Still Waters kids, Stephen told me, are going to slowly read and study <em>Don Quixote</em> and work together on retelling Cervantes’ classic in various ways, through song, and theater. The goal for this first song, the “Rescuing Song,” was for the children to perform it in public for the first time on April 19, at the Still Waters benefit at Symphony Space in New York, where they’d be accompanied by the likes of Rosanne Cash, Steve Earle and Wesley Stace, who’d also play their own music. They had three months to write it and get it ready.</p>
<p>But that Monday, January 29, before getting down to work, the children clearly wanted to talk about something else. That weekend protestors had massed at JFK airport in response to Trump’s Muslim ban. And Mexico’s president had just cancelled a planned visit to Washington because of Trump’s belligerent “wall” rhetoric, among other contentious issues. Trump was on the children’s mind.</p>
<p>“My social studies teacher told me that the Muslims need to get back because they live <em>here</em> but Trump wants them to stay <em>there</em>,” said one of the children. Stephen decided to spend some time discussing the Trump administration’s threats to punish New York for being a sanctuary city by taking away funds. Why did they think Trump wanted to do that? “Because we are the symbol for freedom,” said 13-year-old Jonathan, who always has a thick lock of hair falling over his left eye, “like America <em>isn’t</em> but New York City <em>is</em>.” Nine-year-old Bryan said, “Donald Trump should visit the Statue of Liberty and see the broken chain at her feet. That broken chain means freedom.” And eight-year-old Keyla, with two thick braids and large blazing eyes, spoke emphatically: “Donald Trump has a small and dark heart.”</p>
<p>Throughout that autumn, the students had been reading <em>Don Quixote</em> both in the original Spanish and in Edith Grossman’s celebrated English translation. So far, they’d gotten up to chapter eight.  Monday and Tuesday evenings are dedicated to the project, when a core group of approximately 15 students, ages 7 to 15, meets to discuss what they’ve read and to collaboratively translate certain passages into their own words. Over the next five years these children will move from childhood into adolescence alongside Cervantes’s text. The idea, Stephen explained, is for <em>Don Quixote</em> to become a source of collective identity for the children, who mostly live in Bushwick, and are almost all from Mexican and Ecuadoran immigrant families. He wants them to weave stories from their own lives into what they adapt from Cervantes’s novel for their theater and song versions, and for those songs, he said, “to be inspired by moments or ideas that the kids feel are part of their own lives.” Eventually a Still Waters theater troupe will perform these songs in serial “Adventure Plays” fashioned from the same material.</p>
<p>Edith Grossman had recently visited Still Waters to talk to the children abou<em>t Don Quixote—</em>afterward she declared that the novel “has never been in better hands”—and so had William Egginton, a Johns Hopkins professor and author of a recent book about Cervantes, <em>The Man Who Invented Fiction. </em>Other recent guests include Mexican novelist Alvaro Enrigue, and on the non-literary side of things, an expert in wind turbines had visited to teach the children about the physics of windmills.</p>

<p>Stephen Haff, 52, who with his messy blond-gray hair, intense blue eyes and expressive lips recalls a rumpled, gentler Klaus Kinski, with eyeglasses riding low on his nose, usually wearing a Mets cap, was born in Colorado and raised in Canada. He studied literature as an undergraduate, and came to the US to earn a master’s degree at the Yale School of Drama, after which he worked in New York theater before discovering his calling, or at least made the first life-changing decisions that brought him to that calling: he became a high school teacher in the Bronx and then in Bushwick, where he also formed a theater group for inner-city kids, the Real People Theater, that was invited to perform Shakespeare in Europe and Canada and elsewhere. That project, but also his frustration with the seemingly intractable, harsh realities of New York’s public school system—he left his teaching job in 2008—and the overcoming of his own personal crisis with depression and bipolar disorder along the way, resulted in Stephen’s founding of Still Waters in a Storm as an experimental collaborative learning space.</p>

<p>For the first two years, he met with former high school students and members of the theater group in a pizza parlor; successful colleagues from his past in professional theater helped finance the move to Stanhope Street. Stephen, his wife, and their three children live in Bushwick, too; along with his family, Still Waters in a Storm is the center of his life, a visionary laboratory of educational and artistic creativity and service to community. Stephen told me that the Don Quixote Project represents the culmination of all that he&#8217;s learned from over 20 years of involvement in theater and as an activist educator.</p>
<p>That first song, about rescuing, was inspired by a pair of incidents in chapters four and five of <em>Don Quixote</em>, when the book’s questing hero, the Sorrowful Knight, the righter of wrongs, first tries to free a shepherd boy from a whipping by his master, and by a subsequent scene in which a farmer comes upon Don Quixote lying on the ground after he has been badly pummeled by a muleteer. The farmer, in Grossman’s translation, “wiped the fallen man’s face, which was covered in dust, and lifted him onto his own donkey.” To the kids at Still Waters, that moment of kindness to a needy stranger became a foundation stone to the building of their first <em>Don Quixote </em>song, one inspired by the challenge and meaning of rescue <em>right now</em>. And it was a response to the insecurities and fears that Donald Trump’s three-week-old presidency was bringing into the lives of immigrant families in Bushwick and throughout this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="pullquote">Eight-year-old Keyla, with two thick braids and large blazing eyes, spoke emphatically: “Donald Trump has a small and dark heart.”</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Imagine how they are feeling,” Stephen replied when I asked how Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies were affecting the kids at Still Waters. “They talk about it every day in conversation outside of class, sometimes with fear and tension, other times by laughing, and they write about it, and they relate what we&#8217;re studying—<em>Quixote</em>, ancient Roman political leaders—to what’s happening today in this country.”</p>

<p>At first I’d planned to visit Still Waters, riding the G and L trains to the DeKalb Avenue stop, for two or three Mondays, thinking that would be enough to satisfy my curiosity about the Quixote Project.  But Stephen Haff never lets go of a friend, or potential friend, of Still Waters so easily, and the children and young teens who gather there exert their own irresistible pull. And I wanted to see how the song was going to turn out (though I didn’t foresee it was going to take 11 weeks before it was ready to be performed). It also felt important to find out how Trump and his government were actually affecting the children. What was it like for a young brown girl to know that the “most powerful man in the world” had hurled crudely bigoted insults against her family’s nationality, her race—deriding Mexican migrants as criminals and rapists—or to have to live with these new threats against the integrity and safety of her family, much more direct and ominous than any she and the other children might have heard or picked-up on before, certainly living in Bushwick? Were those children already being harmed, and if so, in what ways?</p>
<p>I suppose I was hoping for glimpses, passing insights; you couldn’t expect an eight-year-old to have processed something like that into a fully conscious and articulate understanding of what was being done to them, could you? Especially when, across the land, plenty of highly educated adults were still reeling in confusion over the new national reality. But it was going to take more than a couple of weeks to write that song, which, I soon realized, was also going to be an explicit working out and expression, individual and collective, of what those kids were experiencing.</p>

<p>Over the next 11 weeks I came nearly every Monday night to Still Waters with my wife Jovi to watch and listen as the children—guided by Stephen and Kim Sherman, the multi-genre composer of the musical <em>O Pioneers,</em> and of other choral works—slowly built their “Rescuing Song,” collaborating on the lyrics and music, drawing on their reading discussions and translations of<em> Don Quixote,</em> along with shared stories and thoughts about their own lives. I hung on every word, riveted to their conversations, and also, I always found, transfixed by the facial expressions of those children tightly gathered around a long table as they spoke, listened, mused, agitated for Stephen to call on them next, or just let their minds wander. That core group of Quixote kids included Jamie, Leslie, Jonathan, Elias, Michelle, Natalia, David, Sarah, William, Bryan, Bryant, Kimberly, Keyla, Jason, Jaylee, Aylen, and Amelia. As the weeks passed, the beautiful chorus, with its C, A minor and F chord progression and hymn-like melody, became a part of my life; all day long I found myself humming or singing from it. Walking to the subway, Jovi and I sang it out loud.</p>
<p>The Saturday sessions at Still Waters are attended by many more neighborhood children, and parents (usually mothers) bring food they’ve cooked at home—it&#8217;s also when famous writers visit. The likes of Richard Price, Zadie Smith, Michael Ondaatje, Peter Carey, Claire Messud, and many more have garnered Still Waters most of its publicity and helped spur fundraising (most recently Monica Lewinsky came to talk about bullying—“the kids loved her,” Stephen wrote to me).  But it is the school week sessions that demand the most commitment from the children and their families—these comprise the real laboratory for Stephen Haff’s wizardly adventures in collective learning and creation. For these children, it is the norm to wake at dawn for six-and-a-half to eight-and-half-hour schooldays at public or charter schools. Schooldays are followed by at least two hours of homework, which they often come in to do at Still Waters, where Haff and other volunteers help out.</p>
<p>Wednesdays and Thursdays Haff gives classes in Latin—the blackboard at the front of the room has chalked conjugations of the Latin verb to love<em>, Amo Amas Amat Amamus Amatis Amant</em>or—and this year they’ve also been studying ancient Roman history, along with reading Oscar Wilde’s <em>De Profundis</em>. Thursday evenings the students form small groups for creative writing workshops led by volunteer writers and MFA students; for four years, I mentored a small writing group of girls, beginning when they were seven and eight, getting to work with some of them—Jannethy and Betzi, always writing her hilarious stories about a character named Sushi Man—into their early adolescence. By five in the afternoon, when the Quixote workshops usually start, the children are tired, hungry, or feeling pent-up and restless—even in the cold, the boys and some of the girls kick a soccer ball around on the sidewalk until Stephen calls them in. Nachos and avocado delivered from a local restaurant arrive at the start of each session to help fuel them for the last hours of their long, demanding days.</p>

<p>But that first Monday the “Rescue Song” still didn’t have a single lyric, or a melody, or a refrain. In other words, it didn’t exist. There was only an idea for a song about rescue, inspired by<em> Don Quixote</em> and by the students own lives. The immediate challenge, Kim Sherman explained to them, was to get to work building rhymes by bringing words from the novel into the song, or words of their own. To work from, they had, first of all, the image of the farmer lifting the beaten Don Quixote from the ground.<em> Le limpia el rostro</em>. The farmer cleans his face, so covered in dirt and dust that Don Quixote is unrecognizable. One moment of kindness. Stephen said, “Come up with a refrain that ties it all together. What is the point of view of the song? Is it, <em>I saw this thing happen</em>?” He drew their attention to the passage where Don Quixote, newly embarked on his quest, thanks heaven for the opportunity to be a chivalrous knight and rescue someone, or help someone.</p>
<p>“The refrain will come from <em>Don Quixote</em>,” Stephen told them, “and the verses will be your story.”</p>
<p>The children sitting around the table that afternoon came up with plenty of ideas for the refrain:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">“<em>Gracias doy al cielo</em>.”<br />
“I promise to make more care with the sheep.”<br />
“Shameful to beat someone who can’t defend himself.”<br />
“Sometimes you have to pick up your lance and fight.”</p>
<p>And Keyla offered, “Make them feel they belong here and make them feel happy.”</p>
<p>“Awake, arise or be forever fallen,” said Bryan, grinning proudly, lifting his head so that his eyeglasses shone with light. Those words are from Milton’s<em> Paradise Lost</em> which Stephen and the children had studied together at Still Waters last year.</p>

<p>The children pored over their photocopied pages of refrain ideas and suggestions they’d come up with the previous week. These included such phrases as, “I will help you,” “I will protect you,” “They don’t have a voice,” and “Imagine a world.” Then everyone voted for the ones they liked best: the top five vote-getters included, “Feel deep in your heart to help,” “We will make you feel you belong here,” and, finally, “Can we help? Can we help?” (Two months later, when the song was finally finished, Kim would recall the moment 15-year-old Leslie, with an air of tender gravity, had come out with these latter words, spoken in the rhythm of the refrain they became.)</p>
<p><em>Can we help, can we help, can we help</em>.  In C, A minor and F, repeated three times. Followed by:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>We will protect you with our song.<br />
</em><em>Can we help, can we help, can we help.<br />
</em><em>We feel deep in our hearts you belong.</em></p>
<p>By the end of that Monday class, though still without music, the refrain had come into existence, inspired by the passage about the farmer who wipes the dirt from Don Quixote’s face, and by the children’s own sense of threatened safety and tenuous belonging.</p>
<p>“What you’ve made is brilliant and beautiful,” Stephen Haff told them just before the session ended 6:30, when the mothers, mostly, and other relatives began arriving to pick the children up and take them home.</p>

<p>The following Monday began with Stephen Haff discussing recent news reports of ICE grabbing immigrants out of court houses, and how immigration lawyers and activists were advising immigrant families <em>to not answer the door</em> should ICE come seeking entry. It was stomach-churning to watch as the children listened to Stephen, the fear and worry filling their eyes. I almost wanted Stephen to stop, though understood it was necessary advice he was sharing, advice that people have to hear over and over until it becomes automatic, practically instinctual: <em>Do not answer the door</em>.</p>
<p>Over that Monday’s session and the next, the first verse of the “Rescuing Song” came into being. We all listened as Stephen read the extraordinary monologue in <em>Don Quixote</em> of the beautiful shepherdess Marcela, who defends herself against the male shepherds who blame her for the suicide of lovesick Grisóstomo, whose unsought love she had spurned.</p>
<p>Of those shepherds, Leslie said, “They don&#8217;t love her, they want her body, not her soul.” The class had already decided that the verse should be told from the point of view of immigrants like themselves and their families, and Stephen had them write brief monologues. If they could speak to Cervantes, what would they want him to understand about them? Afterward, the children read their monologues out loud.</p>

<p>“I want you to understand we are a united family, we have to take care of each other. You’re building a wall but tearing down laws.”</p>
<p>“I’m confused and praying all the time without knowing what’s going to happen tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“I did not cross the border, the border crossed me. If you don’t want us to come stop glamorizing your country around the world. Stop promising me things then threatening me.”</p>
<p>“I want you to understand that life is difficult these days. I am an independent girl with a little sister.”</p>
<p>“I am a woman with two children and I have a family that is suffering.”</p>
<p>“Here I am at the wall face to face. I want you to understand that my dream is being stopped. I can’t have my opportunity. The opportunity to be with my family.  To have an education.  To become who I want to be when I grow up. I can’t because of the wall.”</p>
<p>“13-year-old child with a 9-year-old sister. I have a family, I want to see my family, I’m trying to flee my country. We are at war and I’m just an innocent bystander watching everyone die, waiting for my death as I’ve been sent back.”</p>
<p>In their monologues they told Cervantes what they wished Trump and the rest of the United States would understand.</p>
<p>“Good rhyme,” Kim had taught them, “happens when you land on the right place with the important words.” She explained musical rests between words, and silent beats.  Their emerging song was in 4/4 time, 4 beats to the measure. The verse, and the song, now had its opening line:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">I <strong>beg</strong> you to under<strong>stand</strong> me, to <strong>list</strong>en to my <strong>voice</strong>.</p>
<p>The first and third beats were the strong ones.</p>
<p>Then Kim held up some sheet music and told the class she’d been working on the melody. “It’s a first draft,” she said. “This will be 10 percent writing, 90 percent rewriting. Do not fear the rewrite. Now we’re starting to put words to notes.”</p>
<p>They discussed how they wanted the music to feel, and Jamie, 14, who wants to study music and sings in a choir, said, “I would keep it mezzo piano, we need it to be soft to show the message.” The refrain, they decided, could move in a different way than the verse. Leslie said, “The refrain can have a faster tempo, urgent.” Kim played the melody through for the first time, and when she was done, everyone applauded.</p>
<p>Jonathan made the second line of the verse he’d come up with fit the melody by simply adding the word, <em>here</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">I’m not asking to be revered <strong>here</strong>.</p>
<p>He explained, “We don’t want to them to love us, but to understand and accept us.” It was Jamie who then came up with an astonishing revision in Kim’s melody, suggesting that that line begin on a minor chord, E minor. Michelle agreed and said, “Minor makes the song more sad.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">I just want to have a choice.</p>
<p>That’s the next line of the verse, repeated twice, the second time—this was Leslie’s idea—with the notes rising. “It’s so beautiful when it goes back up again,” she said. And Jamie, who has a quiet, seemingly aloof punk demeanor but never misses a thing, said, “The beginning should be quiet and then shift to forte, it sounds great.” Leslie: “Invite them in quietly.”</p>
<p>Stephen wanted some verses to be in Spanish. “Right now,” he said, “people and families are being separated. Your language is part of that. There are people who think only English should be spoken here. We need to hear immigrants speaking their own language.”</p>
<p>And that was how, <em>Por favor, entiéndanme</em> became the next line of the verse.</p>
<p>“This is the hard part,” said Kim, by which she meant completing the second half of the verse. “Now we have to match this structure.” She spoke about the challenge of writing “towards the rhyme,” rather than just writing a phrase you like and trying to tack on a rhyme. Revere, here, fear—they’d nailed those rhymes. Now everyone wanted find a way to emphasize “wall.” Maybe it could be rhymed with “fall.” The idea of falling and getting up, the way Don Quixote and Sancho always do.</p>
<p>Leslie said, “People who are racists and who are against immigrants have walls in their brains.” Right after that, always cheerful Brian said, “Ignorance builds a wall.“ And then Leslie added, “They give you like two hours to pack up and leave everything you’ve established.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Ignorance built this wall.</p>
<p>Now they had the next line of their verse.</p>
<p>But they needed something to rhyme with “wall.” It was getting late, there were only minutes left in the class. But nobody wanted to go home without finishing the first verse. “We’re all family after all.” “Don’t let my dreams fall.” That was when seven-year-old Sarita chimed in with, “My family is the best of all.” Which she quickly amended to, “My family is MY best of all,” a radiant, pixie grin showing up ear-to-ear. It was almost magical, the way it clicked and everyone knew. One last change: they decided on <em>mi famila </em>for the beginning of the line.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Ignorance built this wall,<br />
I don’t want to live in fear<br />
Mi familia is my best of all</p>
<p>Followed by the refrain:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Can we help, can we help, can we help</p>
<p>As she waited for her mother to arrive, Sarah, who’d saved the day, sat at the upright piano playing with two fingers while balancing a plastic pencil case on her head. Kim sat down beside her and began to teach her how to play with her third and fourth fingers. “Next time I came in” Kim recalled later, “I found Sarah sitting there playing the way I showed her.” Another time Kim found Jonathan sitting at the piano playing Tchaikovsky. He had never taken piano lessons. “He’d just figured it out,” said Kim. “That guy’s just got an ear.”</p>

<p>The following Monday, Kim started class by explaining that the second verse would be even more of a challenge because it had to match the structure of the first.</p>
<p>William, a fidgety seven-year-old wearing plastic turquoise glasses that looked like swimming goggles, couldn’t stop looking through his pile of Pokemon cards, and Stephen said, “I’m not going to spend the whole class saying ‘William put the cards away.’” It’s sometimes hard to keep the attention of a room full of children who’ve already been in school all day, and Stephen’s extraordinary stream of pedagogical discourse, cheerleading, cajoling, inquiry, guidance, confiding, listening and more listening, is punctuated too by incessant, sometimes scolding, tugs at the children’s attention—“Sit up… pay attention… stop talking… look at me”—that provide a kind of running syncopation to the sessions, provoking chastened smiles, and tired eyes forced opened in willed alertness—and occasionally a fleeting moment of sullenness over a little scolding. Several of the Still Waters mothers I spoke to told me they admired Stephen’s strictness, and the way he teaches their children to listen.</p>

<p>Minutes later, as the class was discussing how to translate a passage from <em>Don Quixote</em> that begins <em>Déjate de eso y saca fuerzas de flaqueza</em>, Jonathan came up with, “Stop whining and find strength in your weakness and I shall do the same, and let’s see how Rocinante is doing because it seems like he received the short end of the stick.” Goggled, antic William quickly interjected, “That is an idiom!  I learned that word in school. Like if you say, <em>That is the last straw</em>, that means, the last time. That’s an idiom!” Another student couldn&#8217;t remember where in the novel that speech occurred and William responded right away, “It’s when Don Quixote goes charging through the sheep and the shepherds throw rocks at them. The horse got the worst of it.” From where I was sitting I could peek into the book bag into which William had obediently put his Pokemon cards, and I saw it was stuffed with two thick copies, each well thumbed, of <em>Don Quixote,</em> one in Spanish, and the other Edith Grossman’s English version. (One afternoon a few weeks later, I’d hear William exclaim about Don Quixote, “He loves words because he reads too many books, just like me!”)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Siempre deja la ventura una puerta abierta en las desdichas, para dar remedio a ellas.</em></p>
<p>Jonathan held up his phone, he’d just Googled the somewhat antiquated word, <em>ventura.</em> “Fortune,” he said.</p>
<p>Fortune in what sense? Stephen asked the others.</p>
<p>David: “A lot of money.”</p>
<p>William: “Luck. The future. Good academic success.”</p>
<p>Jonathan: “Fate.”</p>
<p>Kylee: “Magic.”</p>
<p>Michele: “An open door.”</p>
<p>And <em>desdichas</em>? asked Stephen.</p>
<p>Jonathan: “I’m thinking ditches.”</p>
<p>“Stop crinkling the cellophane,” Stephen called across the table at William, who’d reached for the cookies. “So, fortune always leaves a door open in misfortune,” he went on, “<em>para dar remedio a ellos.</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>Remedio</em>, to give medicine,” said Kimberly.</p>
<p>Leslie: “To give remedy to misfortunes.”</p>
<p>William: “Falling into volcanoes!”</p>
<p>Fortune leaves a door open to give remedy to misfortunes. “They keep believing that if they get up again and again and keep going,” said Stephen, “things will get better.”</p>
<p>From a hilltop, Don Quixote mistakes the flocks of sheep he sees for armies. Sancho of course only sees sheep. And this brilliant little boy, goggle-eyed William, said, “Don Quixote is telling Sancho, You’re afraid to face the truth. That’s irony.” In his prologue to Grossman’s translation, Harold Bloom wrote that Thomas Mann especially loved <em>Don Quixote</em> for its ironies.</p>
<p>Leslie clapped her hands to her head, and groaned, “It’s <em>his</em> reality.” Then she wondered out loud if Sancho was being a good friend or a bad one in not insisting to Don Quixote on the truth about the sheep. Does a good friend, she asked, indulge a crazy person? Recently on Spanish language television she’d watched a show in which one teenage boy says to another, Stop doing drugs, or else I’m not going to be your friend. “Is that really being a good friend?” Leslie asked. Harold Bloom<em>,</em> contrasting <em>Don Quixote</em>’s protagonists to the soliloquists of Shakespeare’s plays, describes the relationship between the mad Knight and his squire as literature’s unsurpassed portrayal of friendship, though it is a relationship, as both William and Leslie perceived, of ironic and often painful complications.</p>

<p>The second verse of “The Rescue Song” directly addresses immigration. The children went back to brainstorming over their printouts of passages from the novel to translate, refrain ideas, their own monologues&#8230; they also tried out some new ideas. “I came here to have a better life and get away from the gangs.” “Create an ocean. Not a dam.” “I might be different than the people who came here, but…”</p>
<p>But when Jonathan said: <em>I came here to seek protection</em>, the second verse had its first line.</p>
<p>Everyone agreed, initially, that the word “life” should set up the next rhyme: <em>I came here to seek protection, to look for a better life</em>, something like that. But Stephen warned that a line about coming in search of a better life was kind of cliché, and asked for something more specific.</p>
<p>“Why are we pointing out that we’re different?” asked Leslie. “What are we implying? We <em>do</em> live here.”</p>
<p>“The first verse is establishing, <em>I want you to understand me</em>,” said Kim Sherman. “Like, <em>I want to have a fair shot</em>.” What should the second verse say? Someone suggested replacing “life” with “night,” which could be rhymed with “fight” or “flight.” Kim sang, “Lalalalalala <em>night</em>,” and Keyla’s head bounced along. Leslie said, “Escape through the harrowing night.” Stephen, who wanted to find a way to evoke Emma Lazarus’s Statue of Liberty poem in the song, suggested, “Huddled masses in the night.” That immediately evoked for Leslie one of the iconic experiences of Latin American immigration to the US border, the kind of journey undertaken by so many of the Still Waters kids’ parents and other relatives: “The people are very close together—they are in a truck, are one body and are all together.” One of the two girls sitting together, both wearing eyeglasses, either Natalia or Michelle, I didn’t register which, enunciated the phrase, “I traveled through the night.”</p>
<p>Kim asked the group what feeling they wanted to express in the verse, and Jonathan answered, “The sadness you felt when you left your country. Sadness, melancholy. Also, deportation results in depression.” Leslie said, “Describe the setting of where they’re going through, you know, the desert, the eagles flying by.” Brian suggested, “Trump is deporting people and people are running away.” Leslie responded, “No, adding <em>his</em> name to the song, ugh.” “Yeah,” said Jonathan, “putting his name in would create a wince.” Keyla: “It would make people <em>ill.</em>”  Stephen Haff again suggested using some Statue of Liberty language, something about coming for opportunity maybe, but Leslie said no, that was too general.</p>
<p>That Monday, in a way I hadn’t quite heard them do before, the Still Waters kids voiced anger and disillusionment with the country where most of them had been born, though their parents hadn’t been. The relentless news of aggressive measures against immigrants, the wall, the random arrests and deportation, even of mothers without criminal records&#8230; all of this was having an effect, and was clearly getting to some of them.</p>
<p>“People want to be citizens,” said Jonathan, “but they still love their country of origin, you desperately want to stay there but you can’t. A word like <em>country</em>, it can carry so many different meanings.”</p>
<p>“But if someone comes here fleeing gang violence,” said Kimberly, Leslie’s younger sister, “they don’t want to go back.”</p>
<p>Jonathan insisted, “Or else they want to build something and go back to Mexico. We can’t just state one reason, we have to state all.”</p>
<p>Leslie said, “When you come here it’s because you have to. But it doesn’t have to be one or the other, both are your real homes.”</p>
<p>Aylen, 14, poised and thoughtful, said, “I don’t know what side of the wall I belong on. Part of me is here, part of me is elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“Lady Liberty,” said Leslie, “why are you claiming her if you haven’t met her yet?”</p>
<p>Jonathan said, “What is that light that has gone dark.”</p>
<p>“The sun, the sun could kill you. Remember the farmer wipes the dust off Don Quixote’s face,” said Stephen, and asked for another phrase in Spanish. “The Latin root for the word translate is to <em>carry across,”</em> he said. “Carrying the meaning across. Crossing borders, all of this is about carrying across.”</p>
<p>Keyla repeated:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">I traveled through the night.</p>
<p>The verse, which drew on their discussion, and followed the structure of the song they’d constructed in the first verse, now began to come together.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Adios, preciosa patria.<br />
Found myself in burning light.<br />
Burning burning desert light.</p>
<p>Seven-year-old Sarah exclaimed, “Burning light is like Tyger Tyger burning bright!” She was remembering the William Blake poem they’d read at Still Waters last summer.</p>
<p>“What comes next in this story?” asked Stephen.</p>
<p>Jonathan said, “America’s potential kindness.”</p>
<p>We were again running out of time, grappling and grasping for the end of another verse. What comes next in this story?</p>
<p>Sarah: “They saw a tiger, or a coyote.” Suddenly the seven-year-old girl was telling us the story her mother had told her about how she’d come to this country riding in a truck with animals, and how she’d come across the border on the back of a tiger.</p>
<p>Someone crossing into the USA on a tiger! What a great ending to the second verse that was going to make! Everybody went home smiling over Sarita’s magic realist epiphany. But, apparently, at the next Monday night session—that was one I missed—they just couldn’t find the rhyme. But the spirit of Sarah and her mother’s story did survive in what would eventually be the last line of the verse:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Nobody wants your throne<br />
We’re not going to steal your gold<br />
But innocence needs a home.</p>

<p>In the three weeks since eight-year-old Keyla began being tutored in reading at Still Waters, her reading level at her primary school had risen from H (well below 2nd grade) to M (beginning 3rd grade). Michelle rose from the middle to the top rank, number one, in her 6th-grade English class. Rachel, Jamie’s 16-year-old big sister, told me that if it hadn’t been for Still Waters, she was sure she wouldn’t have gotten into the High School of Art and Design, where she is now studying graphic design.</p>
<p>An eighth grader, Jamie had recently taken entrance exams for La Guardia, Brooklyn Tech, and other demanding schools. Her mother, Andrea, told me that her daughters&#8217; vocabularies had expanded after coming to Still Waters. “I can help them up to a point,” she said, “but then my own English fails me.” Andrea said that her daughters’ perspectives of other people had also expanded at Still Waters, that they’ve learned everyone deserves respect.</p>

<p>“It’s a safe place,” she said, where she can leave her children without any worries during her own long workdays cleaning houses in Manhattan—most of the Still Water mothers I spoke to work as housecleaners in the city. It’s not as if Still Waters is the only place where children from immigrant families can get help with their homework while their parents work in the afternoons, but, Andrea said, “The other places don’t have Stephen.”</p>
<p>Jamie told me that since coming to Still Waters her class participation in school has also improved, and she’s begun feeling less fearful of expressing her thoughts; her reading and writing have improved too. “Before, in my writing,” she said, “I was very basic, I didn’t have details.” She would just write that <em>it was a tree</em>, she explained, not that it had apples, or that it was green. Her stories started getting longer, with more detail, and the teachers at her school noticed.</p>
<p>Bryan’s mother, Maria, from Ecuador, at first thought Still Waters was a bookstore: whenever she passed by on Stanhope Street the sill of its front window would be lined with books. She enrolled Bryan when he was seven. Two years later, she told me, she’s noticed great changes. Bryan has become more disciplined and organized. “In school, he speaks up now and answers questions,” she said. “Before he used to be very timid.” He’s learned to listen to other people, she stressed, and added that, “Before, he didn’t like to read.” Now he’s become a nine-year-old boy who goes around quoting from <em>Paradise Lost.</em> “Stephen has a magic wand,” said Maria. Even on days when he doesn’t have school, Bryan comes to Still Waters in the afternoon to study. Bryan’s mother has been cleaning houses in New York for 12 years, and her husband works in construction. By saving money and taking out loans in Ecuador, they’ve recently been able to pay for their two older sons’ long journeys to the US to reunite the family. Both sons are already working—one wants to save his money so that he can return to Ecuador and continue his university studies in engineering. Maria told me that she feels blessed. Yet she knows how suddenly it could all end.</p>

<p>There is no application process for Still Waters. Stephen says that people just bring their kinds by and “if I&#8217;m not overwhelmed I let them in.” But usually there is a waiting list of a hundred children. “I call them when there’s room,” he explained, “But I also let some in when there’s a family or friend relationship. Meaning when I’m already working with their cousins or neighbors. This tends to bring stability to the group.”</p>

<p>What do children need? That was going to be the subject of the third and final verse. Once again the children shared ideas and made lists. Children need nachos, the city, freedom of expression, nature, shelter, family, food, friends, rights, safety, imagination, respect, (McDonald&#8217;s and Burger Kings according to Sarita), bedtime stories, hugs, bikes, responsible grownups&#8230;</p>
<p>Leslie said that as the song’s first verse began with the children begging to be understood, this last one shouldn’t have a begging tone, it should be stronger. “Something that says, <em>I pick you</em>,” she said. “A gesture, hold my hand.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Hold my hand please, and save my childhood.</p>
<p>“Together” would be the first word of the next phrase—but together what? Together we can “fight<em>.</em>” But then Kimberly suggest it should be “play” rather than “fight<em>.</em>”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Together let’s go play.</p>
<p>“Pretending to be heroes is the best kind of play,” said Leslie. “We always save the day.” <em>Let’s pretend that we are heroes </em>became the song’s next line. And then Sarah chimed in:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">We are here to save the day.<br />
Always here to save the day.<br />
Por favor entiéndanme!</p>
<p>And then came this suggestion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Responsible grown-ups, listen to me!</p>
<p><em>“</em>Yes, I like it, let’s do it!” exclaimed Kim after some discussion, though “responsible grown-ups” would have to be somehow “shmushed” into a single beat. A chanted command from the children demanding to be paid attention to, to be noticed. (Later, on April 19, when they performed their song before a nearly packed house at Symphony Space, the way they sang <em>Responsible grown-ups, listen to me! </em>had the pluckiness of <em>It’s a hard knock life</em> and provoked a wave of laughter from the audience.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Somos niños no nos ven? (We’re children, can’t you see?)<br />
Déjanos ser feliz. (Let us be happy.)</p>
<p>Followed by the final <em>Can we help </em>repeated three times<em>, </em>with the second and fourth lines of the refrain:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">We are reflected in your eyes<br />
Come across, reach the lost paradise.</p>
<p>Stephen had told the class that day about how his four-year-old daughter, looking into his eyes, had exclaimed, “Daddy, I see myself in your eyes.” Jamie reworded it into the song lyric, and said she was thinking about how the immigrant often sees herself reflected in the other’s eyes.</p>
<p>The spoken-word bridge, inserted between the second and third verses but composed afterward, brought back words the kids had already translated from <em>Don Quixote</em>, including, <em>Siempre deja la ventura una puerta abierta</em>, which Jamie said should be recited in a staccato<em>.</em> And Stephen Haff got his wish as Emma Lazarus’s <em>Give me your tired, your poor</em>, made it into the bridge as well. Though no one liked having to say those words, <em>wretched refuse.</em></p>
<p>Three verses, and three choruses in which the second and fourth phrases vary, and a spoken-word bridge before the final verse. A four-minute song. On a Monday afternoon in mid-April, the Still Waters Quixote Project kids all gathered to sing and rehearse the full song for the first time. Several times they sang it from beginning to end, in every version their voices growing stronger. Then we all applauded.</p>
<p>Kim told everyone, “This thing that you made is now a song, and it exists, and it’s like it was always there. Wow. This is a <em>thing</em>.” And Stephen Haff said, “It came from <em>Don Quixote </em>and all the conversations we had about it and from our own stories, everything we’ve worked on this year, in a song. And it’s beautiful.”</p>

At 25 cents a copy, <em>The</em> <em>Penguin</em> was conceived by a group of impoverished young San Francisco writers as a West Coast answer to <em>The</em> <em>New Yorker</em>: The cover features an illustration lampooning FDR’S National Recovery Administration, and advertises “fiction, sports, satire, drama, fashions, and people.” The paper is crumbling and yellow, the glue of the spine long ago food for bugs. I’m afraid to even touch the thing, lest it disintegrate entirely.</p>
<p>On page nine (across from an ad for a transatlantic luxury liner) is <em>The</em> <em>Penguin</em><em>’</em><em>s</em> masthead. There are eight names listed under the editorial staff, and one of them is my grandfather’s: Jeffrey Weinberger.</p>
<p>The grandfather I knew growing up was not an outwardly literary man, though he was an avid reader (politics, biographies and thrillers, mostly). He was, instead, a businessman, who for 40-odd years owned a successful import-export firm that shipped cement to Central America, pomade to the Philippines, and guns to Zimbabwe. He lived to be 97 years old, and by any measure lived a damn full life: Family, friends, career success, world travel.</p>
<p>And yet, of the meager 11 pages of memoir that he left behind when he died—scribbled in spiky handwriting on yellow binder paper during the last years of his life—fully two of them are devoted to the handful of years he spent as a journalist and aspiring literary magazine editor in Depression-era San Francisco; pages that are crammed with dropped names and laced with wistful pride. In comparison, my grandmother merited two sentences. His two daughters—my mother and aunt—aren’t mentioned at all.</p>
<p>His years as a writer comprised less than four percent of his life; but vastly more of his imagination. Sometimes the lost dreams we once had for ourselves—the near-misses, that-which-almost-was—loom larger in our memories than they deserve. We can’t release the people we once thought we might be, despite intervening years of blunt reality. As a writer myself, I was happy to aid in his delusion.</p>
<p>I don’t remember having much of a relationship with my grandfather when I was young: He was a classic patriarch, delighted to have his descendants around him but not quite sure how to interact directly with kids. (My grandmother was the one who invited me to dinner and called on birthdays.) It wasn’t until I graduated from UC Berkeley and got an editorial assistant job at <em>Wired</em> that my relationship with my grandfather shifted. Not long after I accepted the position, he pulled me aside during a visit—it was quite possibly the first time he’d ever taken individual interest in me, his second-oldest grandchild—and, with a conspiratorial smile on his face, offered a little autobiographical nugget that changed my opinion of him forever: “I used to be a writer for magazines, too.”</p>
<p><em>A magazine writer</em>? I’d had no clue. Suddenly, I saw my grandfather in a whole different light—not just a penny-pinching, business-minded curmudgeon who refused to pay for long-distance phone calls and grumbled about the news, but a journalist (like me!) who once sought <em>truth</em>. Someone who palled around with literary stars and aspired to a byline in <em>The New Yorker</em>. Someone as infatuated with words as I was. How had I not known this about him?</p>
<p>In the years that followed (especially after my grandmother’s death), my grandfather and I began to nurture a more intimate relationship: I’d visit him at his retirement home for lunch, or a game of dominos, and prod him for whatever details he could dredge out of the sea of his fading memories. I learned that after dropping out of UC Berkeley in 1930 (his family was too broke for tuition), he’d found a job at the <em>San Francisco News</em>, a Scripps Howard daily evening paper, working as a city staff reporter; and then as a “leg man” at the <em>San Francisco Examiner</em>, primarily on the police beat, until the Depression caught up with him in 1933 and he was laid off. (When he died, I inherited his press badge, an official-looking lump of metal straight out of a noir-era film.)</p>
<p>As he recalled in the yellow, handwritten pages, “This was a fascinating life. I met all the big shots, all the little shots, and went along with the crowd to Izzy Gomez, Blue Fox, Black Cat, etc.” At age 22, when he first relayed this information to me, I had no clue what those references meant. It wasn’t until I started digging deeper that I realized that my grandfather was part of a legendary period in San Francisco’s literary scene.</p>
<p>His home base during those years was the Monkey Block—a huge apartment building in North Beach that was considered the bohemian center of San Francisco, home to artists, writers, and actors going back to Mark Twain and Ambrose Bierce. (Lawrence Ferlingetti would later dub it “the most famous literary and artistic structure in the West.”) He palled around there with a group that would someday be quite famous, including the novelist William Saroyan, the celebrated playwright/screenwriter Sam Taylor, Emmy-winning comedy writer Larry Rhine, and Jack London’s daughter, the socialist writer Joan London. The Depression had left them all with an excess of free time.</p>
<p>According to my grandfather, they spent these unemployed hours drinking grappa-laced ginger ale at notorious speakeasies like Izzy Gomez and the Black Cat; and all-nighters sitting on the floor by fireplaces in Monkey House flats, talking politics and literature. The short-lived <em>Penguin </em>was an outgrowth from those evenings—an attempt by this group of writers to give themselves writing jobs when no one else would. Their plans were lofty, if underfunded: As an essay in <em>The Penguin</em> recalls its own genesis: “Still the dulling depression, but from it springs a live, vibrant thing… an authentic expression of youth, and a recording of the life and thought of Western America.”</p>
<p>Unlike his friends, my grandfather’s writing career ultimately went nowhere. I honestly couldn’t tell you if this was because he lacked talent, or if it was a matter of circumstance; but not long after <em>The</em> <em>Penguin</em> failed, my grandfather got work as a shoe salesman and as far as I know, never wrote another word. Regardless, something about the idea of my grandfather drifting through this era, with his grand visions and fascinating friends, clung to me in my early years as a writer, like a forgotten family inheritance that I hoped to claim.</p>
<p>I spent my own post-college years as a journalist in San Francisco in the 1990s, a time in which the literary legacy of San Francisco seemed to be dying. Ferlingetti’s City Lights still sold books in North Beach, but you were more likely to find dotcom types milling around the area than writers or artists (who&#8217;d largely been pushed out by rising real estate prices). There was still no West Coast <em>New Yorker</em>. Instead, the best jobs available to aspiring writers like myself were at technology publications like <em>Wired</em> and online magazines like <em>Salon</em>.</p>
<p>I worked at both publications in my twenties, and loved my time at each; but I couldn’t help feeling that the San Francisco literary culture I truly coveted, the one my grandfather had briefly lived, was gone. No wonder I glamorized the stories that he told me; no wonder that I idealized the idea of him drinking grappa with William Saroyan while plotting a magazine. And yet, from my perspective today, I can see that I was doing the exact same things he was at my age, just in more modern permutations—launching an online publication instead of a print one; going to illegal break-in parties at warehouses instead of drinking at speakeasies; staying up late talking culture and politics with friends who (even if I didn’t know it then) would someday claim similar sorts of success as his.</p>
<p><em>His</em> stories had history on their side, lending them the idealistic sheen that only comes from nostalgia; but mine, while more mundane, actually led to a career. No wonder he was so excited by my fledgling vocation as a writer: My life paralleled his own so closely, but I was somehow making it work where he hadn’t.</p>
<p>When my grandfather died, seven years ago, <em>The</em> <em>Penguin</em> was the only possession of his that I asked for; hoping that, in some way, reading it would open a wider window into his life back then. It didn’t, not really. It <em>is</em> an interesting document of the period, but it’s not exactly a fun read. The prose is stiff and anachronistic and peppered with curious slang, and the political essays that were probably provocative back in 1933 (including an essay by Elliot Roosevelt—son of FDR—entitled “I Dislike Politics,” and the cover feature bemoaning the fact that “there is no real youth movement in America”) are full of references that are difficult to grasp in 2017. I found myself mostly interested in the women’s section, which features a personal essay about being a “lady cub reporter” and a think-piece entitled “Home or Career? Has the Depression forced women back into the home?”</p>
<p>Only one essay really jumped out at me as offering insight into my grandfather’s life, an essay entitled “Write East, Young Man.” The essay warns overly ambitious young writers away from trying to write for the “literary type—<em>Atlantic Monthly, Scribners, Harpers—</em>and the slick paper magazines of popular appeal—<em>Saturday Evening Post, Colliers, Liberty, Red Book, Hearst International</em> and the like… The ‘slicks’ are not the ideal field for the young writer to seek expression—not at first.” Instead, the author suggests trying pulp magazines:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Take your typewriter and your thesaurus and a copy of <em>Gang Guns</em> or <em>Frontier Romances</em> or <em>Love Tales</em> and study it well. Then sit down to try to duplicate the story as to plot and construction. Eventually you will sell. Even if you don’t, you will at least be writing, and strange though it may seem, that is the only formula for learning to write.</p>
<p>It’s oddly timeless advice—substitute “websites” for pulp magazines and it would be the same advice I might offer to a writer starting out today (with perhaps less focus on straight-up copying). It’s the same advice I took myself, after I finally quit my stable job at <em>Salon</em> at age 29 in order to try my hand at fiction. I wrote for anyone who would take me, even if it meant writing about nail polish for dogs for women’s magazines, or interviewing D-list reality TV stars. Ghostwriting, copywriting, blurb writing—I did it all, in order to pay the bills while I worked on a novel, which is what I <em>really</em> wanted to do. At least I was writing. And the more I wrote, the more confident my writing became.</p>
<p>But my grandfather clearly didn’t absorb this piece of advice. And looking back now, it’s obvious that my grandfather wasn’t, at heart, ever a <em>writer. </em>The piece of me that for decades has been driven to write and keep writing—even when faced with failure, or rejection, or impoverishment—is not something that he ultimately shared; otherwise his literary career wouldn’t have ended with the demise of <em>The</em> <em>Penguin</em>. Perhaps it was more the romance of the lifestyle, or a simple love of reading, that initially drew him to that career, more than the act of putting words to paper. The proximity to “big shots” and “little shots,” the hope that he might someday be one of them.</p>
<p>“I always thought I’d write a book,” my grandfather once told me; but there was nothing in his papers when he died that suggested he ever even tried.</p>
<p>And yet I still wonder how much of my career I owe to my grandfather, to the frustrated writer genes inside him that were passed down to me, whether intentionally or not. It certainly wasn’t something that was discussed when I was a child; and yet I imagine it trickling through anyway, through the love of reading that was dominant in my family, through the encouragement that my family gave me when I told them I wanted to be an author when I grew up.</p>
<p>Not long before my grandfather died, I published my first novel, <em>All We Ever Wanted Was Everything</em>. I brought him a copy in his retirement home, and he was delighted as he held it in his hands and read the inscription. “My granddaughter, the published author,” he said proudly, his eyes watering; then went off to brag about me to his friends. After he died, I found the novel in his bookshelf, looking suspiciously unread. To the very end, he was still more in love with the idea of writing than in the writing itself.</p>
<p>In that, I can see, we were never the same.</p>

<strong>Nuremberg’s Palace of Justice</strong></p>
<p>A little after three o’clock in the afternoon, the wooden door behind the defendant’s dock slid open and Hans Frank entered courtroom 600. He wore a gray suit, a shade that was offset by the white helmets worn by the two somber-faced military guards, his escorts. The hearings had taken a toll on the man who had been Adolf Hitler’s personal lawyer and then personal representative in German-occupied Poland, with his pink cheeks, sharp little nose, and slicked-back hair. Frank was no longer the slender and swank minister celebrated by his friend Richard Strauss. Indeed, he was in a considerable state of perturbation, so much so that as he entered the room, he turned and faced the wrong direction, showing his back to the judges.</p>
<p>Sitting in the packed courtroom that day was the professor of international law at Cambridge University. Balding and bespectacled, Hersch Lauterpacht perched at the end of a long wooden table, round as an owl, flanked by distinguished colleagues on the British prosecution team. Seated no more than a few feet from Frank, in a trademark black suit, Lauterpacht was the one who came up with the idea of putting the term “crimes against humanity” into the Nuremberg statute, three words to describe the murder of four million Jews and Poles on the territory of Poland. Lauterpacht would come to be recognized as the finest international legal mind of the 20th century and a father of the modern human rights movement, yet his interest in Frank was not just professional. For five years, Frank had been governor of a territory that came to include the city of Lemberg, where Lauterpacht had a large family, including his parents, a brother and sister, their children.</p>
<p>When the trial had opened a year earlier, their fate in the kingdom of Hans Frank was unknown.</p>
<p>Another man with an interest in the trial was not there that day. Rafael Lemkin listened to the judgment on a wireless, from a bed in an American military hospital in Paris. A public prosecutor and then a lawyer in Warsaw, he fled Poland in 1939, when the war broke out, and eventually reached America. There he worked with the trial’s American prosecution team, alongside the British. On that long journey, he carried a number of valises, each crammed with documents, among them many decrees signed by Frank. In studying these materials, Lemkin found a pattern of behavior, to which he gave a label, to describe the crime with which Frank could be charged. He called it “genocide.” Unlike Lauterpacht, with his focus on crimes against humanity, which aimed at the protection of individuals, he was more concerned with the protection of groups. He had worked tirelessly to get the crime of genocide into Frank’s trial, but on this last day of the trial he was too unwell to attend. He too had a personal interest in Frank: he had spent years in Lwów, and his parents and brother were caught up in the crimes said to have been committed on Frank’s territory.</p>
<p>“Defendant Hans Frank,” the president of the tribunal announced. Frank was about to learn whether he would still be alive at Christmas, in a position to honor the promise he had recently made to his seven-year-old son, that all was fine and he would be home for the holiday.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Thursday, October 16, 2014, </strong><br />
<strong>Nuremberg’s Palace of Justice</strong></p>
<p>Sixty-eight years later I visited courtroom 600 in the company of Hans Frank’s son Niklas, who was a small boy when that promise was made.</p>
<p>Niklas and I began our visit in the desolate, empty wing of the disused prison at the rear of the Palace of Justice, the only one of the four wings that still stood. We sat together in a small cell, like the one in which his father spent the better part of a year. The last time Niklas had been in this part of the building was in September 1946. “It’s the only room in the world where I am a little bit nearer to my father,” he told me, “sitting here and thinking of being him, for about a year being in here, with an open toilet and a small table and a small bed and nothing else.” The cell was unforgiving, and so was Niklas on the subject of his father’s actions. “My father was a lawyer; he knew what he did.”</p>
<p>Courtroom 600, still a working courtroom, was not greatly changed since the time of the trial. Back in 1946, the route from the cells required each of the 21 defendants to travel up a small elevator that led directly to the courtroom, a contraption that Niklas and I were keen to see. It remained, behind the dock at which the defendants sat, entered through the same wooden door, which slid open as noiselessly as ever. “Open, shut, open, shut,” wrote R. W. Cooper of <em>The Times </em>of London, the former lawn tennis correspondent who reported each day on the trial. Niklas slid the door open and entered the small space, then closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>When he came back out, he made his way to the place where his father sat during the trial, charged with crimes against humanity and genocide. Niklas sat down and leaned forward on the wooden rail. He looked at me, then around the room, and then he sighed. I had often wondered about the last time his father passed through the elevator’s sliding door and made his way to the defendant’s dock. It was something to be imagined and not seen, because cameras were not allowed to film the last afternoon of the trial,  on Tuesday, October 1, 1946. This was done to protect the dignity of the defendants.</p>
<p>Niklas interrupted my thoughts. He spoke gently and firmly. “This is a happy room, for me, and for the world.”</p>
<p>Niklas and I were together in courtroom 600 because of an invitation I had unexpectedly received several years earlier. It came from the law faculty of the university in the city now known as Lviv, an invitation to deliver a public lecture on my work on crimes against humanity and genocide. They asked me to talk about the cases in which I’d been involved, about my academic work on the Nuremberg trial, and about the trial’s consequences for our modern world.</p>
<p>I had long been fascinated by the trial and the myths of Nuremberg, the moment in which it was said our modern system of international justice came into being. I was mesmerized by odd points of detail to be found in the lengthy transcripts, by the grim evidence, drawn to the many books and memoirs and diaries that described in forensic detail the testimony that was laid before the judges. I was drawn to the images, the photographs and black-and-white newsreels and movies like <em>Judgment at Nuremberg, </em>the 1961 Oscar winner made memorable by its subject and Spencer Tracy’s momentary flirtation with Marlene Dietrich. There was a practical reason for my interest, because the trial’s influence on my work had been profound: the Nuremberg judgment blew a powerful wind into the sails of a germinal human rights movement. Yes, there was a strong whiff of “victor’s justice,” but there was no doubting that the case was catalytic, opening the possibility that the leaders of a country could be put on trial before an international court, something that had never happened before.</p>
<p>Most likely it was my work as a barrister, rather than my writings, that prompted the invitation from Lviv. In the summer of 1998, I had been peripherally involved in the negotiations that led to the creation of the International Criminal Court (ICC), at a meeting in Rome, and a few months later I worked on the Pinochet case in London. The former president of Chile had claimed immunity from the English courts for charges of genocide and crimes against humanity laid against him by a Spanish prosecutor, and he had lost. In the years that followed, other cases allowed the gates of international justice to creak open, after a period of quiescence in the Cold War decades that followed the Nuremberg trial.</p>
<p>Cases from the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda soon landed on my desk in London. Others followed, relating to allegations in the Congo, Libya, Afghanistan, Chechnya, Iran, Syria and Lebanon, Sierra Leone, Guantánamo, and Iraq. The long and sad list reflected the failure of good intentions aired in Nuremberg’s courtroom 600.</p>
<p>I became involved in several cases of mass killing. Some were argued as crimes against humanity, the killings of individuals on a large scale, and others gave rise to allegations of genocide, the destruction of groups. These two distinct crimes, with their different emphases on the individual and the group, grew side by side, yet over time genocide emerged in the eyes of many as the crime of crimes, a hierarchy that left a suggestion that the killing of large numbers of people as individuals was somehow less terrible. Occasionally, I would pick up hints about the origins and purposes of the two terms and the connection to arguments first made in courtroom 600. Yet I never inquired too deeply as to what had happened at Nuremberg. I knew how these new crimes had come into being, and how they subsequently developed, but little about the personal stories involved, or how they came to be argued in the case against Hans Frank. Nor did I know the personal circumstances in which Hersch Lauterpacht and Rafael Lemkin developed their distinct ideas.</p>
<p>The invitation from Lviv offered a chance to explore that history.</p>
<p>I seized it for another reason: my grandfather Leon Buchholz was born there. I knew my mother’s father for many years—he died in 1997 in Paris, a city he loved and called home—but I knew little about the years before 1945, because he did not wish to talk of them. His life spanned the entire 20th century, and by the time I knew him, his family had diminished in size. That I understood, but not the extent or the circumstances. A journey to Lviv was a chance to learn more about those painful years.</p>
<p>A few scraps of information were available, but for the most part Leon locked the first half of his life into a crypt. They must have been significant for my mother in the years after the war, but they were also important for me, events that left lingering traces and many unanswered questions. Why had I chosen the path of the law? And why law of the kind that seemed to be connected to an unspoken family history? “What haunts are not the dead, but the gaps left within us by the secrets of others,” the psychoanalyst Nicolas Abraham wrote of the relationship between a grandchild and a grandparent. The invitation from Lviv was a chance to explore those haunting gaps. I accepted it, then spent a summer writing the lecture.</p>
<p>A map showed Lviv to be right in the center of Europe, not easily accessible from London. It stood at the midpoint of imaginary lines, connecting Riga to Athens, Prague to Kiev, Moscow to Venice. It was the crossing of the fault lines that divided east from west, north from south.</p>
<p>Over the course of a summer, I immersed myself in the literature about Lviv. Books, maps, photographs, newsreels, poems, songs, in fact anything I could find about the city of “blurred borders,” as the writer Joseph Roth called it. I was particularly interested in the first years of the 20th century, when Leon lived in this city of bright colors, the “red-white, blue-yellow and a touch of black-gold” of Polish, Ukrainian, and Austrian influences. I encountered a city of mythologies, a place of deep intellectual traditions where cultures and religions and languages clashed among the groups that lived together in the great mansion that was the Austro-Hungarian Empire. World War I collapsed the mansion, destroying an empire and unleashing forces that caused scores to be settled and much blood to be spilled. The Treaty of Versailles, the Nazi occupation, and Soviet control combined in quick succession to work their mischiefs. The “red-white” and “black-gold” faded, leaving modern Lviv with a Ukrainian population, a city now dominated by “blue-yellow.”</p>
<p>Between September 1914 and July 1944, control of the city changed eight times. After a long spell as the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire’s “Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and the Grand Duchy of Kraków with the Duchies of Auschwitz and Zator”—yes, it is <em>that </em>Auschwitz—the city passed from the hands of Austria to Russia, then back to Austria, then briefly to the Western Ukraine, then to Poland, then to the Soviet Union, then to Germany, then back to the Soviet Union, and finally to Ukraine, where control resides today. The kingdom of Galicia on whose streets Leon walked as a small boy was one shared by Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, and many others, yet by the time Hans Frank entered courtroom 600 on the last day of the Nuremberg trial, which was less than three decades later, the entire Jewish community had been extinguished, and the Poles were being removed.</p>
<p>The streets of Lviv are a microcosm of Europe’s turbulent 20th century, the focus of bloody conflicts that tore cultures apart. I have come to love the maps of those years, with streets whose names often changed, although the course they followed did not. One park bench, a fine art nouveau relic from the Austro-Hungarian period, was a place that I came to know well. From here I could watch the world go by, a fine vantage point on the city’s changing history.</p>
<p>In 1914, the bench was in the <em>Stadtpark, </em>the city park. It stood across from the grand <em>Landtagsgebäude, </em>the parliament of Galicia in the easternmost province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</p>
<p>A decade later, the bench hadn’t moved, but it was in a different country, in Poland, in Park Kościuszki. The parliament had disappeared, but not  the building, now the home of the Jan Kazimierz University. In the summer of 1941, as Hans Frank’s General Government took control of the city, the bench was Germanized, now in the <em>Jesuitengarten </em>across from a former university building now stripped of its Polish identity.</p>
<p>Those interwar years were the subject of a significant literature, but no work described more evocatively what had been lost than <em>Mój Lwów </em>(My Lwów). “Where are you now, park benches of Lwów, blackened with age and rain, coarse and cracked like the bark of mediaeval olive trees?” the Polish poet Józef Wittlin inquired in 1946.</p>
<p>Six decades later, when I arrived at the bench on which my grandfather could have sat a century earlier, I was in the Ivan Franko Park, named in honor of a Ukrainian poet who wrote detective novels and whose name now graced the university building.</p>
<p>Wittlin’s idyllic reminiscence, in its Spanish and German translations, became my companion, a guide across the old city and the buildings and streets scarred by the fighting that erupted in November 1918. That vicious conflict, between Polish and Ukrainian communities with Jews caught or targeted in the middle, was grave enough to be reported in <em>The New York Times</em>. It caused the U.S. president, Woodrow Wilson, to set up a commission of inquiry. “I do not wish to disturb the wounds on the living body of these memories, and so I won’t talk about 1918,” Wittlin wrote, and then proceeded to do exactly that. He evoked “fratricidal fighting between Poles and Ukrainians” that cut the city into parts, leaving many caught between the warring factions. Yet common courtesies remained, as a Ukrainian school friend briefly halted the fighting near the bench on which I sat to allow young Wittlin to pass and make his way home.</p>
<p>“Harmony reigned among my friends, although many of them belonged to different ethnicities that were at loggerheads, and professed different faiths and views,” wrote Wittlin. Here was the mythical world of Galicia, where National Democrats loved Jews, socialists tangoed with conservatives, Old Ruthenians and Russophiles wept alongside Ukrainian nationalists. “Let’s play at idylls,” Wittlin wrote, evoking “the essence of being a Lvovian.” He depicted a city that was sublime and loutish, wise and imbecilic, poetic and mediocre. “The flavor of Lwów and its culture is tart,” he concluded wistfully, like the taste of an unusual fruit, the <em>czeremcha, </em>a wild cherry that ripened only in Lwów’s Klepary suburb. Wittlin called the fruit a <em>cerenda, </em>bitter and sweet. “Nostalgia even likes to falsify flavours too, telling us to taste nothing but the sweetness of Lwów today. But I know people for whom Lwów was a cup of gall.”</p>
<p>The bitterness festered after World War I, suspended but not settled at Versailles. Periodically, it flared up with a vengeance, as when the Soviets rolled into town on white horses in September 1939 and again two years later with the arrival of the Germans in their tanks. “In early August 1942 Governor General Dr. Frank arrived in Lvov,” a Jewish resident recorded in a rare surviving diary. “We knew that his visit did not bode well.” That month, Hans Frank, Hitler’s lawyer of choice and now Governor General of occupied Poland, ascended the marble steps of the university building to deliver a lecture in the great hall in which he announced the extermination of the city’s Jews.</p>
<p>I arrived in Lviv in the autumn of 2010 to deliver my lecture. By then, I had unearthed a curious and apparently unremarked fact: the two men who put crimes against humanity and genocide into the Nuremberg trial, Hersch Lauterpacht and Rafael Lemkin, had been residents of the city in the period of which Wittlin wrote. Both men studied at the university, experiencing the bitterness of those years.</p>
<p>This would not be the last of many coincidences that passed across my desk, but it would always be the one that cut deepest. How remarkable that in preparing a journey to Lviv to talk about the origins of international law, I learned that the city itself was intimately connected to those origins. It seemed more than just a coincidence that two men who did more than any others to create the modern system of international justice should have origins in the same city. Equally striking was the sense that in the course of that first visit, not a single person I met at the university, or indeed anywhere in the city, was aware of its role in the founding of the modern system of international justice.</p>
<p>The lecture was followed by questions, generally directed to the lives of the two men. On what streets did they live? What courses did they take at the university, and who were their teachers? Did they meet or know each other? What happened in the years after they left the city? Why did no one talk about them at the law faculty today? Why did one of them believe in the protection of individuals and the other in the protection of groups? How had they become involved in the Nuremberg trial? What became of their families?</p>
<p>I didn’t have answers to these questions about Lauterpacht and Lemkin.</p>
<p>Someone then asked a question I could answer.</p>
<p>“What’s the difference between crimes against humanity and genocide?” “Imagine the killing of 100,000 people who happened to come from the same group,” I explained, “Jews or Poles in the city of Lviv. For Lauterpacht, the killing of individuals, if part of a systematic plan, would be a crime against humanity. For Lemkin, the focus was genocide, the killing of the many with the intention of destroying the group of which they were a part. For a prosecutor today, the difference between the two was largely the question of establishing intent: to prove genocide, you needed to show that the act of killing was motivated by an intent to destroy the group, whereas for crimes against humanity no such intent had to be shown.” I explained that proving intent to destroy a group in whole or in part was notoriously difficult, since those involved in such killings tended not to leave a trail of helpful paperwork.</p>
<p>Does the difference matter? someone else asked. Does it matter whether the law seeks to protect you because you are an individual or because of the group of which you happen to be a member? That question floated around the room, and it has remained with me ever since.</p>
<p>Later in the evening, a student approached me. “Can we speak privately, away from the crowd?” she whispered. “It’s personal.” We moved toward a corner. No one in the city knew or cared about Lauterpacht and Lemkin, she said, because they were Jews. They were tainted by their identities.</p>
<p>Maybe, I responded, not knowing where she was headed.</p>
<p>She said, “I want to let you know that your lecture was important to me, <em>personally </em>important for me.”</p>
<p>I understood what she was telling me, sending a signal about her own roots. Whether a Pole or a Jew, this was not a matter to be spoken of openly. Issues of individual identity and group membership were delicate in Lviv.</p>
<p>“I understand your interest in Lauterpacht and Lemkin,” she continued, “but isn’t your grandfather the one you should be chasing? Isn’t he the one closest to your heart?”</p>

Centered on a fictional riot in contemporary Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, it’s told from the perspectives of characters of various ages, genders, economic classes, sexualities, and, most notably, races. I’m a straight white man, and when I began to tell people about my novel, reactions tended to fall across the spectrum from “What have you gotten yourself into?” to “Who do you think you are?”</p>
<p>This was just about the same time as Lionel Shriver’s speech at the Brisbane Writers Festival in which she mocked how sensitive some readers were about cultural appropriation. After seeing reactions to mere descriptions of my novel, what struck me most about the argument over Shriver’s speech was not either side’s case—one side warning genuinely about co-opting minorities’ voices, the other side stressing the importance of empathy outside one’s own perspective—but just how inadequate the tradition of white authors writing across races is.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The explanation of this inadequacy tends to go something like this: “From Herman Melville to Harriet Beecher Stowe to Mark Twain to William Faulkner to Harper Lee, the grand American narrative of race was always tackled by white writers, writers who created and inhabited black characters as they would any other.” But then, in 1967, William Styron went too far when he impersonated Nat Turner in the <em>Confessions of Nat Turner</em>. Critics reacted harshly, and “By the early 1990s, the idea of cultural ownership had metastasized into a fully articulated code of conduct, loosely gathered under the umbrella of political correctness,” where authors were frightened into exclusively documenting their own experiences.</p>
<p>I took most of the above paragraph from Tanner Colby’s 2010 essay in <em>Slate</em>, ideas that he primarily credits to Stanley Crouch. But what that argument is missing is the importance of perspective: of whether a novel is written from inside the mind of a Black character, be it in the first person or close third. Patriarchs and matriarchs of American literature might have “created” Black characters, but they did not “inhabit” them. Melville, a hero of mine, included harpooners from around the world in <em>Moby Dick</em>, and he granted them moments of vivid humanity, but he mainly presented them as the savage other. Stowe characterized Tom in a melodramatic style typical of the mid-19th century sentimental novel, and was more concerned with action and good versus evil than subtleties of Tom’s character. (I’d contend that one reason “Uncle Tom” has become such a pejorative—and a mischaracterization of Stowe’s character—is because the reader does not have ample access to his nuanced thoughts and feelings.) Twain’s Jim and Lee’s Tom Robinson are depicted through the eyes of children. And though Faulkner does offer more insight than the others into the psychology of his Black characters, he tends to avoid narrating from their perspectives, as well. One of the most vexing questions a reader has after finishing <em>The</em> <em>Sound and the Fury</em>, for example, is why doesn’t Dilsey’s point of view warrant a chapter of its own? The theme running among these grand works that “created and inhabited black characters” is that they did not fully inhabit them. For the most part, these authors gave Black characters speech and action but not thought.</p>
<p>With Styron, Colby and Crouch are on firmer ground. Styron’s <em>Confessions</em> was not only poorly timed to its zeitgeist—published into a world of Black Power and then, soon after, political assassinations and riots across American cities—but it also presented a white author writing a Black character from a first-person perspective. Styron impersonated a historical figure: an enslaved man, a character no white author has the right to claim as his own. After an initially positive critical reception, the novel was pilloried in the book W<em>illiam Styron’s Nat Turner: Ten Black Writers Respond</em><em>. </em>Though a few of the “ten Black writers” noted that Styron had the right to impersonate Turner and made it a point to criticize his execution as particularly racially ignorant, the feeling that a white writer’s attempt at inhabiting a Black mind is capable of arousing such rancor has been enough to keep most authors, since, at bay.</p>
<p>In 1987, Tom Wolfe wrote <em>The</em> <em>Bonfire of the Vanities</em>, a novel Colby cites (along with Richard Price’s unimpeachable <em>Clockers</em>) as moving white writers back in what he sees as the direction of successfully writing about race. On the contrary, <em>Bonfire</em> is a perfect example of a novel that suffers because its white author is unwilling to write from a Black first- or close third-person point of view.  All three perspectives from which a reader experiences Wolfe’s dystopic vision of race and class in 1980s New York are those of white professional men. Wolfe doesn’t extend the empathy necessary to inhabit any of the Black or female voices the novel relies on for its emotional impact.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>We now live in a time when this type of cross-cultural empathy is especially necessary (frankly, it always was), and I’m hopeful that the anxiety of our current political moment will catalyze new works that take on this challenge. The Black Lives Matter movement has been galvanized by a series of videos of police shootings of Black men, just as President Trump has been elected with vocal support by white nationalist and extremist groups under the banner of the Alt-Right. Black Lives Matter and the Alt Right cannot be divided in fiction, with Black authors telling one story and white authors telling the other.  For one thing, that would be missing the greater narrative of how, for better or worse, one is connected to the other. For another, race is only one component in our intersectional culture. Many white novelists have far more in common with the average member of Black Lives Matter than the average “Deplorable Jane” on Twitter. Race must not be the great, uncrossable line in the sand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, white people aren’t doing Black people any favors by asking their opinions and approval every time we want to know how to feel about a political movement. Towards the end of 2016, <em>Slate</em> published a conversation among four influential Black journalists who agreed that they did not want to be asked to represent people of color in this manner. As Tressie McMillan Cottom wrote, she is tired of white people who contact her every time “they have discovered some ‘new’ thing about race or race/class/gender and want to know <em>what</em> to think. The most recent one was something about black women voting.” Jamelle Bouie agreed: “I am often asked for my advice or guidance on how to achieve racial healing, as if I have or have evinced any particular expertise. To borrow from Tressie, once you have attained some level of visibility as a black writer, there are people who think you become a kind of MLK surrogate.” The implication here is that it is white America’s job to think through the complexity of racial issues for itself, and when a novelist believes a Black voice is warranted to tell his or her side of a story, it is important for that novelist, no matter his or her race, to research, interview, talk, think, and then write that voice as an exercise in empathy, as well as in art and entertainment.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Happily, a trickle of wonderful white novelists over the past decade has taken on the challenge of inhabiting Black characters with a goal of better understanding and expressing their experience and, in so doing, better telling the stories that feel necessary in this moment. The last ten years have produced standout works likes Hillary Jordan’s <em>Mudbound</em> (2008), Belle Boggs’s <em>Mattaponi Queen</em> (2010), Stephen O’Connor’s <em>Thomas Jefferson Dreams of Sally Hemmings</em> (2016), C.E. Morgan’s <em>Sport of Kings </em>(2016), and Thomas Mullen’s <em>Darktown</em> (2016).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the novels that succeed most are the ones that most explicitly confront racial tension. <em>Thomas Jefferson Dreams of Sally Hemmings</em> helped me understand the complexities of racial violence as well as any non-fiction book I’ve read in years. O’Connor is able to blur the lines of his narrative between, on one hand, telling the story of Jefferson’s relationship with and rape of Hemmings, and, on the other, weaving in myriad interconnected stories from academic, anachronistic, and philosophical viewpoints. Jefferson’s relationship with Hemmings is now inseparable from our preconceived notions of it, so O’Connor re-contextualizes that relationship for the reader, intentionally complicating it by creating Hemmings’ perspective. His project is to help the reader better contemplate today’s United States by inventing two very different people who were present at the time of its founding, and it would have been impossible to do so if he didn’t enter into Hemmings’ mind.</p>
<p>Similarly thrilling in <em>Darktown </em>is the way Mullen enriches a crime procedural with the history of discrimination in the South in order to create ancestral depth in his characters. After devouring <em>Darktown</em>, a reader is left wondering how authors have written crime fiction without putting race at its core. The novel grapples with a legacy of racism as thoroughly as it does an individual crime and is equally rewarding as drama and political analysis. Likewise, Boggs, Jordan, and Morgan—on smaller (Boggs) and larger (Jordan and Morgan) canvasses—treat their Black characters with respect, depicting race as a practical obstacle as well as a source of pride and shame in their characters’ lives. Like Mullen, they make the reader care about their characters so passionately that the reader finishes these books with a more nuanced understanding of the world.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Black novelists have had a difficult time breaking free from a different literary history: the presumption that if they did not write novels that demanded empathy for Black torment, there was no need to take them seriously. As Tracey M. Lewis-Giggetts explained in the <em>Guardian</em>, “It’s commonly believed that ‘good’ writing by black authors is birthed from oppression, and marginalization is viewed as a key marker for black literature. This implies a direct link between the authenticity of the literature and the sociological and political perspectives of African Americans.”  Lewis-Giggetts’s claim is borne out by awards as well as reputations: the only five Black novelists to win the National Book Award for adult fiction—Ralph Ellison for <em>Invisible Man</em> in 1952, Charles Johnson for <em>Middle Passage</em> in 1990, Jesymn Ward for <em>Salvage the Bones</em> in 2012, <em>The Good Lord Bird</em> by James McBride in 2013, and Colson Whitehead for <em>The Underground Railroad</em> in 2016—all won for novels depicting suffering caused by racism.</p>
<p>One way Black American authors have negotiated the expectation that the only path to prominence is to write about Black suffering has been, when wanting to address other issues, to write from the perspective of white characters: from Styron’s friend, James Baldwin, who wrote his masterpiece, <em>Giovanni’s Room,</em> about a white man living in France with other white men; to Victor LaValle, whose wonderful <em>Devil in Silver</em> is narrated by a white laborer. Both Baldwin and LaValle write exquisitely about Black suffering, but in <em>Giovanni’s Room</em> and <em>The Devil in Silver</em>, the reader feels they want to focus so much on other issues—for Baldwin, sexuality; for LaValle, mental illness—that writing through the minds of white characters might be a way to, for one novel at least, avoid the need to foreground issues of race. These are still political novels; they’re just not focused on Black politics.</p>
<p>Toni Morrison, however, like many Black authors who are less prominent than she is, is happy to balance the scales in the face of all the white writers who don’t write Black-perspective characters.  She bristled when asked by Bill Moyers when she would get around to writing about white people.  “If I can say, ‘When are you going to write about Black people?’ to a white writer—if that’s a legitimate question to a white writer—then it is a legitimate question to me; I just don’t think that it is…” she said in a later interview to Charlie Rose. “I couldn’t ask that of any writer.”</p>
<p>Morrison is right. It’s no one’s place to tell a writer what to write. But I’m happy to turn Morrison’s rhetorical question around and start encouraging the empathy necessary to think through other’s perspectives. No single novelist should be expected to do anything specific. Morrison should continue to write her novels, which are some of my favorite. But it’d be nice if some more writers were trying. Who better than Paul Beatty, for example, to write from a Trump supporter’s perspective? Or Edward P. Jones from Trump’s, itself. Or Jonathan Franzen in the mind of a member of BLM.</p>
<p>Franzen actually addressed this very issue in July 2016 interview with Isaac Chotiner: “I write about characters, and I have to love the character to write about the character. If you have not had direct firsthand experience of loving a category of person—a person of a different race, a profoundly religious person, things that are real stark differences between people—I think it is very hard to dare, or necessarily even want, to write fully from the inside of a person.” I’m a great admirer of Franzen’s novels, so I wouldn’t doubt what he says works for him, but I’m certain he has written well about characters with professions of people he hasn’t loved, possibly with sexual proclivities of people he hasn’t loved, certainly with backgrounds, motivations, and psychologies of people he hasn’t loved.  It’s time for race to no longer be seen, especially by some of our greatest writers and thinkers, as an unbridgeable, nearly unthinkable gap. There is too much to be said about race right now, and too many inhibitions holding back those of all races who might have something to say.</p>

They&#8217;re literary scholars who have deeply bonded over a shared love for an obscure author. The conversation turns to collegial romance, and the two men begin to press their female colleague on whether or not she has fancied a third man known to all. As they drunkenly continue the lewd discussion in the back of a cab, the driver, a Pakistani immigrant, overhears them. He is not pleased. Suddenly the Pakistani declares that the woman is a “slut” and the men are her “pimps.” After a shocked silence, something terrible happens.</p>
<p>This is a scene from Roberto Bolaño&#8217;s momentous last novel, <em>2666</em>. I was reading it just days after the 2008 edition of Book Expo America, where I had reverently acquired a galley. The book would go on to become a huge best-seller, a critical grand slam, and a winner of a prestigious National Book Critics Circle Award. It is truly a great novel, but as I read this scene, I could not believe what Bolaño had written. The things the academics were about to do to this cab driver were completely out of character—they were so unthinkable that it seemed like a bizarre error, a rare lapse on Bolaño&#8217;s part.</p>
<p>But more and more it has stuck in my mind as prophetic, all too accurate.</p>
<p>So here is what happens. Offended, the academics demand that the driver stop his car. He complies, coolly handing them the bill. This tense moment seems on the verge of fizzling when one of the men opens the driver&#8217;s door and drags him out. As if on cue, the beating commences:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">as they delivered kick after kick, shove Islam up your ass, which is where it belongs, this one is for Salman Rushdie (an author neither of them happened to think was much good but whose mention seemed pertinent), this one is for the feminists of Paris (will you fucking stop, Norton [the woman] was shouting), this one is for the feminists of New York (you&#8217;re going to kill him, shouted Norton), this one is for the ghost of Valerie Solanas, you son of a bitch, until he was unconscious and bleeding from every orifice in the head, except the eyes.</p>
<p>Bolaño wrote this in roughly 2003. When I encountered it in 2008, I honestly thought the worst of this was behind us. Civilized, educated Westerners wouldn&#8217;t do that sort of thing any longer. But increasingly I have seen that in fact Bolaño was foretelling our future. He had intuited some deep resentment that was beginning to assert itself in 2003, and was maybe a little more visible in 2008, and is now becoming monstrously unleashed in 2017, this year of astonishing animosity toward Muslims, Mexicans, and many others.</p>
<p>As a writer, Bolaño was obsessed with the way fascism had immigrated to South America after it was defeated in Europe. His shorter novels tend to deal with what fascism became in places like Chile, but in <em>2666</em> he seems to imply that perhaps fascism has become globalized. The book is stuffed with fascism, albeit not in the sense of goose-stepping thugs and authoritarian leaders, but rather in the texture of daily life. That is, <em>2666&#8217;s </em>fascism is found in the upwelling of deep-bred hatred that makes these meek men beat a taxi driver to within an inch of his life. A sort of fascism that has become profoundly embedded in the culture of educated, economically powerful, liberal democratic nations.</p>
<p>I have thought more and more about this scene these past months, as we have seen Nazi-saluting creeps celebrating Donald Trump in Washington, purveyors of hate engineering incidents designed to provoke violence and chaos, and the spiking of hate crimes and other forms of racialized violence. I have been brought back to this scene as it has bit by bit been demonstrated that the racism at the heart of Trump&#8217;s campaign was decisive in his win, and as our President now defames Mexicans, insults Muslims, incites rage against outsiders, and even uses the name “Pocahontas” to mock a United States Senator. I have thought about this scene, and I have thought how Bolaño detected the rot spreading through Ciudad Juárez long before it was dubbed “the most violent city on Earth,” how he was among the first to zero in on the unique horror of Juárez&#8217;s femicide epidemic, and how he was brave enough to turn these nice academics into enraged barbarians.</p>
<p>Thinking of these things called to mind Bolaño&#8217;s reflection that “literature is basically a dangerous calling.” Let me quote Bolaño in full on this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">A writer’s country isn’t his language or isn’t only his language . . . There can be many countries, it occurs to me now, but only one passport, and obviously that passport is the quality of the writing. Which doesn’t mean just to write well, because anybody can do that, but to write marvelously well, though not even that, because anybody can do that too. Then what is writing of quality? Well, what it’s always been: to know how to thrust your head into the darkness, know how to leap into the void, and to understand that literature is basically a dangerous calling.</p>
<p>When Bolaño says that literature is dangerous to its practitioners, I think it goes back to the state of mind one would have to be in to create characters like <em>2666&#8242;</em>s academics: decent, liberal, incredibly well-educated Westerners who are capable of spouting out feminist pieties while nearly murdering an immigrant with their bare hands. It would touch upon the levels one would have to exist on in order to be sensitive to the inchoate rage that was circulating through Western culture and would soon find itself concentrated in the hateful campaigns of the likes of Donald Trump, Theresa May, Marine Le Pen, and others. Let us not forget that 49 percent of white college graduates were angry enough with the status quo to choose Donald Trump for President.</p>
<p>A writer&#8217;s duty is to see as much of the truth as possible of the society he or she inhabits, and often this is dangerous. Not simply dangerous in the sense of journalists like Ben Jacobs, who in May 2017 was assaulted by a candidate for Congress he was covering, or the many other journalists who have been threatened by Trump and terrorized by his supporters at his rallies—I mean dangerous in the sense of having to get close enough to the darkest sides of a society that it begins to infect your mind. This is precisely what Bolaño did, and anyone who has read his literature knows that it left a profound impact.</p>
<p>Bolaño, of course, saw much more of the worst of humanity than should anyone in a single lifetime. He was born in Chile, and he fought for the regime of Salvador Allende just as a coup d&#8217;etat forced the suicide of this democratically elected president in favor of a dictator. (Bolaño narrowly escaped with his life.) All of this happening while neighboring Argentina—which had descended into fascism itself with its president Juan Perón—was mutating into one of Latin America&#8217;s most hideously grotesque and murderous regimes. He then went to Mexico, a nation that was being ruled by (as Mario Vargas Llosa once called it) the “perfect dictatorship.” And he ultimately settled in Spain, which had just recently relinquished the last vestige of fascism in Europe, a nearly 40-year reign. Given his experiences, it is unsurprising that Bolaño was preternaturally sensitive to a society&#8217;s incipient fascism and the darker aspects of humanity.</p>
<p>You can make a very strong case that fascism is the center of Bolaño&#8217;s massive literary project. Just to name a few larger examples, we can start with the aforementioned <em>2666</em>. Then we have <em>By Night in Chile</em>, which deals profoundly with how fascism fled Europe and took root in the New World. <em>Distant Star </em>brings us face-to-face with what fascist evil looked like on the ground in Chile, bringing together avant-garde art and political torture. <em>Amulet </em>deals with a woman who is terrorized during one of Mexico&#8217;s darkest episodes, the massacres of hundreds of citizens following major political protests in Mexico City in 1968. And <em>Nazi Literature in the Americas </em>is a sort of endeavor to form a gallery of the petty little men and women who use fascist politics and/or techniques to chase literary fame.</p>
<p>Part of the reason we read Bolaño in America is that his life experiences, and his literary errands, gave him enormous insight into how fascism lurks in a society. This is a subject that has long fascinated Americans—think of the popularity of Upton Sinclair&#8217;s 1935 novel about a fascist president, <em>It Can&#8217;t Happen Here</em>, as well as Robert Penn Warren&#8217;s Pulitzer-winner <em>All the King&#8217;s Men</em>, George Orwell&#8217;s <em>1984</em>, Margaret Atwood&#8217;s <em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</em>, and Philip Roth&#8217;s massively bestselling <em>The Plot Against America</em>.</p>
<p>What does Bolaño add to this question that an American author can not? Perhaps Bolaño was the only writer who could give us such deep insight into the nature of political evil while filtering it through the minds of would-be artists who are dominated by a sort of nostalgic romanticism. What this amounts to is a mapping of the difficult, but extraordinarily rich terrain where the most noble aspirations of art overlap with the most perverse aspirations of politics. (And here, Thomas Mann&#8217;s <em>Doctor Faustus</em>, a remarkable inquiry into the similarities between the rise of German avant-garde music and the rise of Nazism, is essential.)</p>
<p>This union of fascism and art has important lessons for us today. When our unbelievably surreal president—who effortlessly conjures enormous lies, changes his mind unpredictably, and breaks all norms of the office—is often compared to a performance artist; when purveyors of outrageous, dangerous lies like the right wing radio personality Alex Jones take cover behind the title of “performance artist”; and when the worst truths of our contemporary politics are frequently uttered by talented comedians who base their newscaster personae off parodies of clown-like Fox News hosts—at such a time, it seems that the overlap of art and politics is something important for us here in America.</p>
<p>So I would like to ask, which of our writers will do as Bolaño said we must and thrust their head into the darkness? I do not know that there is another way to find certain truths we must hear about our nation. These are not things you will read in the newspaper or see debated on CNN. They do not come from a politician&#8217;s mouth. They are not the sort of truths that science will unveil to us. They only come into existence when a writer is working at the edge of things, when their language is being used to articulate the highest degree of literary truth possible—writing that contains more truth than even the writer necessarily realizes. Bolaño gets it just right in his story “Dentist” when he says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The secret story is the one we&#8217;ll never know, although we&#8217;re living it from day to day, thinking we&#8217;re alive, thinking we&#8217;ve got it all under control and the stuff we overlook doesn&#8217;t matter. But every damn thing matters! It&#8217;s just that we don&#8217;t realize. We tell ourselves that art runs on one track and life, our lives, on another, we don&#8217;t even realize that&#8217;s a lie.</p>
<p>We must have writers who are sensitive to the secret story. I do not know exactly who these writers are, but I can tell you that they will be, like Bolaño, citizens of the world who can live up to the words, “A writer’s <em>patria </em>or country . . . is his language.” They will be deeply knowledgeable of the history of political systems, and they will have an intimate familiarity with contemporary politics. They will also care deeply about people—about what motivates them, how their minds work, what drives them to passion, and what makes them terribly afraid. And I think they will be the sort who can grapple in the deepest possible way with these rightly famous lines of Bolano&#8217;s:</p>
<p>A poet can endure anything. Which amounts to saying that a human being can endure anything. Except that it’s not true: there are obviously limits to what a human being can endure. Really endure. A poet, on the other hand, can endure anything. We grew up with this conviction. The opening assertion is true, but that way lie ruin, madness and death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a handful of novels and short stories have managed to clarify, in any lasting way, the meaning of the war in Vietnam for America and for the soldiers who served there. With <em>The Things They Carried</em>, Tim O&#8217;Brien adds his second title to the short list of essential fiction about Vietnam. As he did in his novel <em>Going After Cacciato</em> (1978), which won a National Book Award, he captures the war&#8217;s pulsating rhythms and nerve-racking dangers. But he goes much further. By moving beyond the horror of the fighting to examine with sensitivity and insight the nature of courage and fear, by questioning the role that imagination plays in helping to form our memories and our own versions of truth, he places <em>The Things They Carried</em> high up on the list of best fiction about any war.</p>
<p><em>The Things They Carried</em> is a collection of interrelated stories. A few are unremittingly brutal; a couple are flawed two-page sketches. The publisher calls the book &#8216;a work of fiction,&#8217; but in no real sense can it be considered a novel. No matter. The stories cohere. All deal with a single platoon, one of whose members is a character named Tim O&#8217;Brien. Some stories are about the wartime experiences of this small group of grunts. Others are about a 43-year-old writer &#8211; again, the fictional character Tim O&#8217;Brien &#8211; remembering his platoon&#8217;s experiences and writing war stories (and remembering writing stories) about them. This is the kind of writing about writing that makes Tom Wolfe grumble. It should not stop you from savoring a stunning performance. The overall effect of these original tales is devastating.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the title story, Mr. O&#8217;Brien juxtaposes the mundane and the deadly items that soldiers carry into battle. Can openers, pocketknives, wristwatches, mosquito repellent, chewing gum, candy, cigarettes, salt tablets, packets of Kool-Aid, matches, sewing kits, C rations are &#8216;humped&#8217; by the G.I.&#8217;s along with M-16 assault rifles, M-60 machine guns, M-79 grenade launchers. But the story is really about the other things the soldiers &#8216;carry&#8217;: &#8216;grief, terror, love, longing . . . shameful memories&#8217; and, what unifies all the stories, &#8216;the common secret of cowardice.&#8217; These young men, Mr. O&#8217;Brien tells us, &#8216;carried the soldier&#8217;s greatest fear, which was the fear of blushing. Men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are these simply tricks in the service of making good stories? Hardly. Mr. O&#8217;Brien strives to get beyond literal descriptions of what these men went through and what they felt. He makes sense of the unreality of the war &#8211; makes sense of why he has distorted that unreality even further in his fiction &#8211; by turning back to explore the workings of the imagination, by probing his memory of the terror and fearlessly confronting the way he has dealt with it as both soldier and fiction writer. In doing all this, he not only crystallizes the Vietnam experience for us, he exposes the nature of all war stories</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it fair to readers for Mr. O&#8217;Brien to have blurred his own identity as storyteller-soldier in these stories? &#8216;A true war story is never moral,&#8217; he writes in &#8216;How to Tell a True War Story.&#8217; &#8216;It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If a story seems moral, do not believe it. If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie. There is no rectitude whatsoever. There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil.&#8217; Mr. O&#8217;Brien cuts to the heart of writing about war. And by subjecting his memory and imagination to such harsh scrutiny, he seems to have reached a reconciliation, to have made his peace &#8211; or to have made up his peace.&#8221;</p>

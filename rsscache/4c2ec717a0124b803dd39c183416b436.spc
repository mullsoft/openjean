<p>Theresa May has been asked to urgently clear up the &ldquo;shocking&rdquo; confusion over the Brexit process, after Boris Johnson today directly contradicted David Davis over whether the government had made contingency plans for leaving the EU without a deal.</p><br />
<p>Speaking in the Commons today, the foreign secretary said &ldquo;there is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>However in March, the Brexit secretary sought to reassure voters that the government was prepared.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;We have been planing for the contingencies, all the various outcomes, all the possible outcomes of the negotiation,&rdquo; he told the BBC&rsquo;s Andrew Marr Show.</p><br />
<p>Asked if this included a &ldquo;proper plan for no deal&rdquo;, Davis added: &ldquo;Oh yes, oh yes.&rdquo;</p><br />

<p>Theresa May repeatedly said during the election campaign that &ldquo;no deal is better than a bad deal&rdquo;.</p><br />
<p>Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign, has today written to the prime minister demanding she explain whether her Brexit secretary or foreign secretary was correct.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;These directly contradictory statements emanating from senior members of Cabinet expose a worrying level of confusion within your Government regarding the possible outcomes of the ongoing Brexit negotiations,&rdquo; he said.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;Either the Government has conducted contingency plans regarding a possible &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenario, or it has not. Both cannot be true.&rdquo;</p><br />
<br />
<p>James Chapman, a former senior adviser Davis, said it was &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/jameschappers/status/884741468656730112" target="_blank" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:2,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/jameschappers/status/884741468656730112&quot;}}">factually incorrect</a>&rdquo; to say no planning had been done.</p><br />
<div class="content-list-component text"><br />
<p>Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, criticised the government for failing to produce a contingency plan.</p><br />
</div><br />
<div class="content-list-component text"><br />
<p>&ldquo;It is the prime minister,&nbsp;at least the prime minister for now, who decided to put the idea of the &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; option on the table - and she couldn&rsquo;t stop using the phrase during the election,&rdquo; she told MPs.</p><br />
</div><br />
<div class="content-list-component text"><br />
<p>Thornberry asked Johnson: &ldquo;What would no deal would mean? Can he reassure us, if he is not prepared to tell us publicly, at the very least he has a detailed private plan to manage that risk.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>Labour MP Chris Bryant, said: &ldquo;Boris Johnson&rsquo;s bluster about getting a &lsquo;great deal&rsquo; makes him sound like Donald Trump&rsquo;s unofficial spokesman, not the British Foreign Secretary.&rdquo;</p><br />
</div><br />
<br />
<div class="content-list-component text"><br />
<p>Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, said the lack of a plan for no deal showed a &ldquo;shocking level of complacency&rdquo;.</p><br />
<div class="content-list-component text"><br />
<p>&ldquo;These kind of glib assurances are straight out of the Trump playbook. It is simply not good enough when people&rsquo;s jobs, living standards and rights are all on the line,&rdquo; he said.</p><br />
<p>Johnson also today appeared to contradict Davis when he agreed the UK would not pay a &ldquo;penny piece more&rdquo; to the EU than it already had.</p><br />
</div><br />
</div><br />
<p>It has been reported that Brussels&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cc7eed42-2f49-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a?mhq5j=e2" target="_blank" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:1,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/cc7eed42-2f49-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a?mhq5j=e2&quot;}}">could ask for &euro;60bn, or as much as &euro;100bn</a>, from Britain as the price for leaving the EU.</p><br />
<div class="content-list-component text"><br />
<p>The price tag is based on financial obligations the other member states believe the UK would need to settle on its way out the door.</p><br />
<p>Davis has said the UK will meet its&nbsp;&ldquo;legal&rdquo;&nbsp;obligations. But Johnson told MPs&nbsp;&ldquo;the sums that I have seen they propose to demand from this country seem to me to be extortionate&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><br />
<h4>Chuka Umunna letter to Theresa May:&nbsp;</h4><br />
<blockquote><br />
<p>Dear Prime Minister,</p><br />
<p>You and your Ministers have repeatedly said in reference to leaving the European Union that &ldquo;no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.&rdquo; But today in the House of Commons, the Foreign Secretary stated that the Government has &ldquo;no plan for no deal.&rdquo; This admission would be shocking in its own right, as such a serious possible scenario requires detailed contingency planning by the Government.</p><br />
<p>However, the Foreign Secretary&rsquo;s admission also directly contradicts previous statements made by the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis. In March, Mr Davis clearly stated that officials had put together contingency plans for a no-deal outcome. He even added that the Cabinet had been briefed on these plans. To add to the confusion, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU&rsquo;s former Chief of Staff, James Chapman, has today labelled the Foreign Secretary&rsquo;s claim of there being &ldquo;no plan for no deal&rdquo; as &ldquo;factually incorrect&rdquo;.</p><br />
<p>These directly contradictory statements emanating from senior members of Cabinet expose a worrying level of confusion within your Government regarding the possible outcomes of the ongoing Brexit negotiations. Either the Government has conducted contingency plans regarding a possible &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenario, or it has not. Both cannot be true. Today&rsquo;s events raise a number of urgent questions that must be answered:&nbsp;</p><br />
<ul><br />
<li>Has the Government conducted detailed contingency planning on the possibility of a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenario, or has it not?</li><br />
</ul><br />
<ul><br />
<li>If the answer is yes, then what is the substance of these contingency plans, and will the Government commit to publishing these plans in detail so Parliament and the public can debate and scrutinise them?&nbsp; If the answer is no, how can the Government explain such a shocking lack of future planning?</li><br />
</ul><br />
<ul><br />
<li>How does the Government expect to conduct negotiations with the European Union when even its own Ministers do not seem to know what if any contingency planning has taken place?</li><br />
</ul><br />
<p>As has been repeatedly demonstrated by numerous business groups, employee groups, experts and studies, a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenario would be a disaster for Britain. The impact on the British economy, on British jobs, on standards of living for British citizens and on the rights of Britons living in the EU would be devastating. The Government must abandon its pretence that &lsquo;no deal is better than a bad deal&rsquo;, when we all know that no deal would be the worst of all possible outcomes. Voters will be shocked to learn of the possibility that the Government still has not conducted contingency planning for such a scenario.&nbsp; If it transpires that the Foreign Secretary&rsquo;s statement today was incorrect, it exposes a Government that is approaching the most important negotiations for generations in a state of total confusion.</p><br />
<p>I await your response to these questions with interest.</p><br />
<p>Yours sincerely,</p><br />
<p>Chuka Umunna MP</p><br />

<p class="p1">UKIP MEPs are holding an emergency meeting in Brussels in a desperate attempt to block a far-right anti-Islam campaigner winning the party&rsquo;s leadership</p><br />
<p class="p1">The controversial Anne Marie Waters - backed by former EDL leader Tommy Robinson - is believed to be gaining support in the race to succeed Paul Nuttall as Ukip leader.</p><br />
<p class="p1">There are fears that far-right activists have joined the party in order to instill Waters - who h<span class="s1">as described Islam as &ldquo;evil&rdquo; and a &ldquo;killing machine&rdquo; - as the new leader.</span></p><br />
<p class="p1">Ahead of the MEP meeting this afternoon, Waters sent a letter to Ukip chairman Paul Oakden demanding an explanation for why the party&rsquo;s ruling committee discussed blocking her candidacy at a meeting in June.</p><br />
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ukip-islam-farage-anne-marie-waters_uk_595a4ae7e4b0da2c7324aac0">HuffPost UK revealed earlier this month that all but two of Ukip&rsquo;s 20 MEPs would be prepared to quit the party</a> should she win the contest, and today around a dozen Parliamentarians are meeting to plot their next move.</p><br />
<p class="p1">A source told HuffPost UK: &ldquo;They are discussing what to do, and could decide to put up just one candidate against her for all the MEPs to back.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p class="p1">However, the anti-Waters vote is in danger of being split, as the party&rsquo;s current Deputy Leader Peter Whittle is set to formally launch his leadership bid in Westminster on Wednesday.</p><br />
<p class="p1">The source said the MEPs would be reluctant to get behind Whittle as they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t like&rdquo; the former London Mayor candidate.</p><br />
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Waters, who founded the Sharia Watch pressure group, teamed up with ex-EDL leader Tommy Robinson to launch the anti-Islam group Pegida UK in 2016.</span></p><br />
<p class="p3"><a href="http://forbritain.uk/open-letter-paul-oakden-stephen-crowther" target="_blank">In a letter to the Ukip chairman </a>Paul Oakden and interim leader Steve Crowther, Waters asked for clarity on what the cut off point was for new members to vote in the leadership contest.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p class="p3">&nbsp;<em>Dear Paul/Steve,</em></p><br />
<p><em>I note with interest the minutes of the UKIP NEC meeting held on June 12th 2017.</em></p><br />
<p><em>I note in particular motion 9, which reads:</em></p><br />
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><em><strong>Motion 9: The NEC interprets the Party Constitution as saying that new members must join by August 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;in order to be eligible to vote at the Leadership Election.</strong>&nbsp;Proposed by KF, seconded by SC.&nbsp;Carried by 7-1 (EJ) with no abstentions.</em></p><br />
<p><em>In recent weeks however, it has become apparent that members of the public are regularly informed by Ukip that in order to be eligible to vote in the leadership contest, one must have been a member by June 23rd.</em></p><br />
<p><em>Could you please explain this discrepancy and clarify this matter.</em></p><br />
<p><em>I also note the following sentence contained within the minutes:</em></p><br />
<p><em>If you blocked Anne-Marie Waters for whatever reason, it would require explanation.</em></p><br />
<p><em>Can you please explain this? &nbsp;Why is the NEC holding discussions on blocking a candidate and on what grounds?</em></p><br />
<p><em>I shall of course seek legal advice on the above matters. &nbsp;I have wide support not only among new members but among old, and I therefore have a reasonable expectation of fair dealings.</em></p><br />
<p>Ukip&rsquo;s third leadership election in a year was triggered when Nuttall quit the day after the General Election, in which the party failed to win any MPs and picked up just 594,000 votes - a huge drop from the 3.9million it secured in 2015.</p><br />
<div class="content-list-component text"><br />
<p class="p1">Nigel Farage is not seeking to become leader for a fourth time, leaving the field wide open for Whittle and Waters.</p><br />
</div><br />
<div class="content-list-component text"><br />
<p class="p1">The Guardian has reported that 1,000 new members joining Ukip in the past two weeks has prompted fears of far-right activists attempting to take-over the party.</p><br />
</div><br />
<div class="content-list-component text"><br />
<p class="p1">One source close to the top of the party told HuffPost UK earlier this month that while new people are signing up, others are quitting.</p><br />
</div><br />
<div class="content-list-component text"><br />
<p class="p1">&ldquo;All the decent people have been leaving,&rdquo; they said, adding: &ldquo;The party&rsquo;s being taken over by the Brownshirts Momentum.&rdquo;</p><br />
</div><br />
<div class="content-list-component text"><br />
<p class="p1">Nominations for the leadership close on 28 July, and the result will be announced at Ukip&rsquo;s conference in Torquay on September 29.</p><br />

<p>She got justifiably irate when that wretched Brexit saboteur, Gina Miller, dared to suggest the public in a democratic country might like to know the terms on which the biggest political decision in generations is being conducted.</p><br />

Workload and trust in teachers is central to this but unless the issue of pay and the funding of our schools is addressed it will only get worse. The Government presented its announcement on teachers' pay yesterday as meaning that its 1% pay limit is still in place for teachers.  Actually, the School Teachers' Review Body recommendations involve an increase of 2% for the Main Pay Range, occupied by mainly younger or newer teachers, with a 1% increase on other pay ranges.  So, arguably, the announcement represents another breach of the 1% public sector pay limit.  But that said even a 2% pay rise given the losses already felt by teachers is unlikely to do anything to help schools recruit, retain and deliver better education for children.<br />
 <br />
Alongside the perennial but growing problem of teacher workload, teachers' pay has been a significant factor in the growing teacher supply crisis.  Government targets for recruitment into teaching have been missed for five consecutive years.  Meanwhile, retention has become an increasing problem, with many more teachers in later career deciding to leave teaching well before retirement age. <br />
 <br />
While the Government has just about managed to recruit the required number of new primary teachers, the number of primary classes over 30 has still risen substantially.  Recruitment of new secondary teachers, however, has been well below target.  Secondary school teacher numbers actually fell last year, pushing up the pupil teacher ratio, while the number of lessons taught by non-specialists in key subjects like maths rose.  Failing to recruit the target number of teachers in maths and other key subjects ranging from physics to ICT to French will make the problem worse in the coming years as student numbers increase dramatically.<br />
 <br />
Teachers' pay increases have been 13% below the level of inflation since 2010 under the Government's public sector pay policy.  With inflation forecast to be almost 4% this September, this latest pay announcement will push that figure over 15%.  The pay rate for newly qualified teachers would be over £3500 higher if this pay cap had never been applied.<br />
 <br />
Structural changes promoted by Michael Gove as giving schools "flexibility" on teachers' pay have resulted only in downwards pressure on pay.  Removing national pay scales and imposing "performance related" pay decisions at a time of funding cuts means that teachers are increasingly unlikely to get pay progression either.  New graduates are increasingly aware that previously-guaranteed pay progression in early career is increasingly dependent on the whims of school managers and the state of the school budget.<br />
 <br />
The School Teachers' Review Body is aware of the scale of the problem.  For two years, it has been warning the Government that teachers are paid less than other graduate professionals throughout their careers and that schools are facing problems in attracting high quality teachers.  Last year, it said that a significant pay uplift would soon be required. <br />
 <br />
But it has failed to live up to its own advance publicity.  It has delivered a report which recommends a further real terms pay cut of almost 3% for some and 2% for others.  And yet it continues to say that "there needs to be a longer-term investment in an effective teaching workforce". <br />
 <br />
The NUT will certainly be pressing schools to ensure that all teachers on the Main Pay Range receive a 2% increase, not just newly qualified teachers, and will also support members to receive the pay progression that they are due.  We believe, however, that this year's pay announcement is a missed opportunity which both the STRB and the Government will come to regret as the teacher recruitment and retention crisis becomes still worse.<br />

<p>A public inquiry will be held into the NHS contaminated blood scandal that left 2,400 people dead, Theresa May has announced.</p><br />
<p>The Prime Minister revealed the decision to her Cabinet on Tuesday morning, delighting campaigners and families affected by what has been described as &ldquo;one of the greatest peacetime disasters&rdquo; to hit the UK.</p><br />
<p>Thousands of patients - many of them haemophiliacs -&nbsp;died in the 1970s and 1980s after being given tainted blood infected with hepatitis and HIV.&nbsp;A further 2,500 people survived but still suffer from substantial health issues.</p><br />
<p>Supplies of the clotting agent Factor VIII were imported from the US, some of which turned out to be infected.</p><br />
<p>Some of the plasma used to make the product is alleged to have come from donors like American prison inmates and drug addicts, who sold their blood for cash.</p><br />
<p>No.10 confirmed that it would consult families on the shape of the new probe, which will take the form of either a judge-led public inquiry or a panel similar to that which investigated the Hillsborough disaster.</p><br />
<p>The campaign group Contaminated Blood Campaign tweeted its response.</p><br />

<p>The announcement is a victory for former Health Secretary Andy Burnham and others who have spent years campaigning for justice for those killed by the scandal.</p><br />
<p>Burnham had warned this week that if the Government failed to act he was prepared to go to the police with&nbsp;&ldquo;serious allegations&rdquo; from victims that there had been a &ldquo;cover-up&rdquo;.</p><br />
<p>Allegations included claims that medical records had been falsified, patients tested for HIV and Hepatitis C without their knowledge or consent, including those who tested positive.</p><br />
<p>Burnham said: &ldquo;This day has taken far too long in coming. People have suffered enough through contaminated blood. They have been let down by all political parties and public bodies.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;It is now incumbent on those organisations to work together to give the families truth, justice and accountability without any further delay or obstruction. It is essential that this inquiry looks at both the original negligence and the widespread cover-up that followed.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;It is also crucial that organisations representing victims are fully consulted on the form, membership and structure of the inquiry. Just as with Hillsborough, there must be a &ldquo;families first&rdquo; approach at all times.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>The Haemophilia Society had this week urged ministers to act &ldquo;swiftly to right this historic wrong&rdquo;.</p><br />
<p>It pointed out that many survivors continue to live in poverty, unable to work as careers were cut short due to ill health or to care for loved ones.</p><br />
<br />
<p>The prime minister&rsquo;s spokesman said: &ldquo;It is a tragedy that has caused immeasurable hardship and pain for all those affected and a full inquiry to establish the truth of what happened is the right course of action to take.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;It is going to be a wide-ranging inquiry.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>Health minister Philip Dunne confirmed the news in an emergency Commons debate on the issue, which had been granted to Labour MP Diana Johnson.</p><br />
<p>Former Labour Health minister David Owen, now Lord Owen, has campaigned for years for an inquiry.</p><br />
<p>He told SkyNews: &ldquo;There is a lot of justification for people thinking this has been covered up for a very long time.&rdquo;</p><br />
<br />
<p>Owen told the Commons in 1975 that he wanted the NHS to be &ldquo;self-sufficient&rdquo; in blood products, but the UK continued to import Factor VIII.</p><br />
<p>He suggested on Tuesday that cuts were to blame,&nbsp;&ldquo;because of economies, decisions were taken...&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;the whole commercialisation of blood is an absolute scandal.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>Owen complained that his Department of Health ministerial papers &ldquo;were got rid of&rdquo;. Another health minister, the late Patrick Jenkin, &ldquo;was convinced his papers were weeded out&rdquo; too, he added.</p><br />
<p>Labour MP Johnson has been leading cross-party calls for an inquiry, collating a letter to the PM from six Opposition party leaders last week.</p><br />
<div class="embed-asset embed" data-type="embed-asset" data-provider="Embed" data-title=""><br />
<div class="embed-code"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pleased to co-ordinate 6 Westminster party leaders writing to the PM calling for a U.K. public inquiry into the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ContaminatedBlood?src=hash">#ContaminatedBlood</a> scandal. <a href="https://t.co/A90drDOyJH">pic.twitter.com/A90drDOyJH</a></p>&mdash; Diana Johnson (@DianaJohnsonMP) <a href="https://twitter.com/DianaJohnsonMP/status/883811023983181826">July 8, 2017</a></blockquote><br />

     <br />
<p>Boris Johnson has accused the European Union of demanding an &ldquo;extortionate&rdquo; amount of money in the Brexit negotiations and said the United Kingdom will not pay.</p><br />
<p>It has been reported that Brussels <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cc7eed42-2f49-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a?mhq5j=e2" target="_blank">could ask for &euro;60bn, or as much as &euro;100bn</a>, from Britain as the price for leaving the EU.</p><br />
<p>The price tag is based on financial obligations the other member states believe the UK would need to settle on its way out the door.</p><br />
<p>Speaking in the Commons today, Johnson said: &ldquo;The sums that I have seen they propose to demand from this country seem to me to be extortionate.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>The foreign secretary agreed with eurosceptic Tory backbencher Philip Hollobone who said Brussels should not expect the UK to pay any more money than it already has.</p><br />
<p>Hollobone asked Johnson: &ldquo;Will you make it clear to the EU that if they want a penny piece more then they can go whistle?&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s comments appear at odds with Brexit secretary David Davis, who has said the UK will &ldquo;meet&rdquo; its &ldquo;legal&rdquo;&nbsp;obligations.</p><br />
<p>The foreign secretary also said there was &ldquo;no plan&rdquo; for what would happen if the UK failed to agree a Brexit deal with the EU.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal,&rdquo; he said.</p><br />
<p>But James Chapman, a former senior adviser Davis, said it &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/jameschappers/status/884741468656730112" target="_blank">factually incorrect</a>&rdquo; to say no planning had been done.</p><br />
<p>Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, criticised the government for failing to produce a contingency plan.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;It is the prime minister,&nbsp;at least the prime minister for now, who decided to put the idea of the &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; option on the table - and she couldn&rsquo;t stop using the phrase during the election,&rdquo; she told MPs.</p><br />
<p>Thornberry asked Johnson: &ldquo;What would no deal would mean? Can he reassure us, if he is not prepared to tell us publicly, at the very least he has a detailed private plan to manage that risk.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, said the lack of a plan for no deal showed a &ldquo;shocking level of complacency&rdquo;.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;These kind of glib assurances are straight out of the Trump playbook. It is simply not good enough when people&rsquo;s jobs, living standards and rights are all on the line,&rdquo; he said.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;People should be able to judge Boris Johnson on his actions not his words, with the chance to reject a disastrous Brexit deal and stay in the EU.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>&nbsp;Yesterday Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has said his country wants to seal a free trade agreement with the UK &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; after Britain&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.</p><br />
<p>Turnbull&rsquo;s comments came after he held talks at 10 Downing Street with Theresa May, who revealed that International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will visit Australia in the &ldquo;coming months&rdquo; as part of ongoing talks on an agreement.</p><br />

<p class="ap-story-p"><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/donald-trump">Donald Trump Jr</a> is under increasing scrutiny after it was reported he was aware <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-russia-email-candidacy.html" target="_blank">information he was offered on Hillary Clinton was part of a Russian government effort</a> to influence the 2016 US election.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">The meeting in June of last year between the President&rsquo;s eldest son and a Russian lawyer occurred at the behest of a Moscow-based singer with family ties to Trump&rsquo;s businesses, according to a participant in the talks.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Trump Jr has denied anything came of the meeting although his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/us/donald-trump-jrs-two-different-explanations-for-russian-meeting.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur" target="_blank">story appeared to change a number of times</a> over the weekend.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">But whilst the allegations are potentially juicy, the most interesting aspect is the &ldquo;participant&rdquo; who provided the details in an email.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Meet Rob Goldstone.</p><br />

     <br />
<h4 class="ap-story-p">1) The Basics</h4><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Goldstone is a music publicist at <a href="https://www.oui2.com/" target="_blank">Oui 2 Entertainment</a>&nbsp;and set up the meeting on behalf of his client, Emin Agalarov.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">He&rsquo;s British, from Manchester originally but lives in New York.</p><br />
<h4 class="ap-story-p">2) What Else Do We Know About Him?</h4><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Thankfully, Goldstone appears to be an avid user of social media, from which we can glean a remarkable insight into his life.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">First up, the meeting in question almost certainly did happen because he checked into Trump Tower on the day.</p><br />

<h4 class="ap-story-p">4) Is There Any Other Evidence Linking Trump And Russia?</h4><br />

<br />
<p class="ap-story-p">And he&rsquo;s a regular visitor to Russia.</p><br />

<h4 class="ap-story-p">Anyway, more on the Trump Jr story from the Associated Press.</h4><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">The circumstances surrounding the meeting, and a report by The New York Times late Monday that Trump Jr. was told ahead of time that the source of the information was the Russian government, fueled new questions about the Trump campaign&rsquo;s possible ties to Moscow, which are being scrutinized by federal and congressional investigators.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">The Times reported that Trump Jr., who was a key campaign adviser to his father, was told the Russian government was behind the information on Clinton in an email from music publicist Rob Goldstone. The Times cited three unnamed people with knowledge of the email.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">The report is the first public word that Trump Jr. accepted the meeting with the understanding that he would be presented with damaging information about his father&rsquo;s political opponent and that the material could have emanated from the Kremlin.&nbsp;</p><br />

     <br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Goldstone spoke to The Associated Press earlier Monday to confirm he had set up the meeting on behalf of his client, Emin Agalarov, but he did not disclose the contents of the email described by The Times. Goldstone did not immediately respond to attempts to contact him Monday night.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">In a statement, Trump Jr.&rsquo;s New York-based attorney Alan Futerfas called the Times report &ldquo;much ado about nothing,&rdquo; though he acknowledged his client had received an email from Goldstone to set up a meeting with the purpose of passing along damaging information on Clinton. His statement did not dispute the Times report on the email.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Futerfas said Trump Jr. was not told the specifics of the information and nothing came of the meeting. &ldquo;The bottom line is that Don, Jr. did nothing wrong,&rdquo; Futerfas said in the statement, noting that the younger Trump hasn&rsquo;t been contacted by any congressional panel or Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s office.</p><br />

<p class="ap-story-p">The White House referred questions to the president&rsquo;s son. Mark Corallo, a spokesman for President Donald Trump&rsquo;s outside legal team, would not comment on the Times story, reiterating only that Trump &ldquo;was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Earlier Monday, Trump Jr. tried to brush off the significance of the meeting, tweeting sarcastically, &ldquo;Obviously I&rsquo;m the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent ... went nowhere but had to listen.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Trump Jr. also said on Twitter he was willing to work with the Senate intelligence committee, one of the panels probing possible campaign collusion, &ldquo;to pass on what I know.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Lawmakers on the committee from both parties said they indeed wanted to talk with the president&rsquo;s son. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the panel &ldquo;needs to interview him and others who attended the meeting.&rdquo; Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., agreed, saying, &ldquo;Based on his own admissions, this is an attempt at collusion.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">The sequence of events that led to the June 2016 meeting highlighted the tangled web of relationships that investigators now are sorting through.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">The president&rsquo;s son said the meeting was arranged by an acquaintance he knew through the 2013 Miss Universe pageant Trump held in Moscow.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Trump Jr. initially didn&rsquo;t name the acquaintance, but in an interview with the AP, Goldstone confirmed he set up the meeting on behalf of Agalarov. Goldstone said the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, stated that she had information about purported illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee that she thought Trump Jr. might find helpful.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Goldstone said Trump Jr. agreed to squeeze the meeting into a tight schedule.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Monday the Kremlin doesn&rsquo;t know Veselnitskaya and &ldquo;cannot keep track&rdquo; of every Russian lawyer who holds meetings in Russia or abroad. Although she has not been publicly linked with the Russian government itself, Veselnitskaya represented the son of a vice president of state-owned Russian Railways in a New York money-laundering case settled in May before a trial.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">A staff member at Veselnitskaya&rsquo;s firm told the AP on Monday that she was unavailable for comment.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">During his visit to Moscow, Trump spent time with Agalarov, appearing in a music video with him and several contestants in the pageant, which Trump owned at the time. Agalarov&rsquo;s father, Aras, is a Russian developer who sought to partner with Trump on a hotel project in Moscow and tried to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin during the Miss Universe contest.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">According to The Washington Post and several other media accounts, the elder Agalarov paid Trump $14 million to $20 million to stage the pageant in Moscow. But Aras Agalarov was unable to persuade Putin to meet with Trump. Putin canceled the session, sending a Trump a friendly letter and a lacquered box in appreciation, the Post has reported.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">On Monday, Goldstone said the Trumps and the Agalarovs stayed in contact after the pageant, and Emin Agalarov asked him to reach out to the Trumps to broker the June meeting with Veselnitskaya.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Jared Kushner, Trump&rsquo;s son-in-law and now White House senior adviser, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort attended the meeting. Goldstone said he and a translator also participated.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">During the meeting, Goldstone said, Veselnitskaya made comments about campaign funding &ldquo;that were not specific,&rdquo; and then turned the subject to a discontinued Russian adoption program and the Magnitsky Act , a bill passed in 2012 that allows the U.S. to impose sanctions on Russians for human rights violations.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Goldstone said that at one point during the meeting, Trump Jr. or Kushner said, &ldquo;Can we get to the point?&rdquo; And later, after Veselnitskaya had finished her presentation, Trump Jr. said, &ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo;</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">&ldquo;The whole thing was really vague,&rdquo; Goldstone said. He said he and Trump Jr. were the last to leave the room, and &ldquo;I turned to him and said: &rsquo;I&rsquo;m really embarrassed. I don&rsquo;t know what that was.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Unlike Kushner, Trump Jr. does not serve in the administration and is not required to disclose his foreign contacts.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Over the weekend, Trump Jr. initially omitted any mention of Clinton from his account of the meeting, describing it as a &ldquo;short introductory meeting&rdquo; focused on the disbanded program that had allowed American adoptions of Russian children. Moscow ended the adoptions in response to the Magnitsky Act sanctions.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">A day later, Trump Jr. acknowledged he was told beforehand that Veselnitskaya might have information &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; to the Trump campaign, and was told by her during the meeting that she had something about Clinton.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">&ldquo;No details or supporting information was provided or even offered,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.&rdquo; He said there was no follow-up after the meeting and his father was unaware it happened.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Foreign nationals are prohibited from providing &ldquo;anything of value&rdquo; to campaigns, and that same law also bars solicitation of such assistance. The law typically applies to monetary campaign contributions, but courts might consider information such as opposition research to be something of value.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">Bradley A. Smith, a former Bill Clinton-appointed Republican Federal Election Commission member, said that based on what&rsquo;s known about the meeting, Trump Jr.&rsquo;s actions are unlikely to be considered illegal solicitation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not illegal to meet with someone to find out what they have to offer,&rdquo; Smith said.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">But Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, said the situation &ldquo;raises all sorts of red flags.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">&ldquo;You do not want your campaign to be involved with foreign nationals, period,&rdquo; said Noble, now senior director at the Campaign Legal Center.</p><br />
<p class="ap-story-p">The New York Times first reported the lawyer&rsquo;s meeting with Trump Jr. and the meeting&rsquo;s prospect of negative information about Clinton.

<br />
During the Brexit process, we must get the best deal for our economy, protect jobs and defend the rights of EU nationals. I will be fighting for that on behalf of my constituents in Midlothian, and I thank them for sending me here to do that.<br />
<br />
I must pay tribute to my predecessor, Owen Thompson, who I know worked hard to represent Midlothian, and I am sure his contribution to the community will be remembered well. I thank him for his congratulations, and for the warm and friendly way in which we conducted our campaign. In his maiden speech, Owen, who was wearing his Midlothian tartan tie, spoke about the green representing the landscape, the blue representing the reservoirs and the black representing the coal in Midlothian.<br />
<br />
Owen remarked that he was the first non-miner in a long time -- since the second world war, in fact -- to be elected to represent Midlothian, and I want to make two points about that. I have another first: I am the first woman to be elected to serve Midlothian, and of that I am very proud indeed. Secondly, although you can see that I myself am not a miner, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am proud to come from good mining stock--both my grandfathers, Willie Rowley and Ron Curran, worked down the mine--so I am keeping that strong Midlothian tradition alive, and I was honoured to receive the endorsement of and support from my local retired miners group.<br />
<br />
Speaking of former miners to represent Midlothian, I would also like to pay tribute to two former Members for Midlothian whom I have the honour of knowing and have learned from, Sir David Hamilton and Eric Clarke. Eric said in his maiden speech:<br />
<br />
"I am proud to be a socialist and a trade unionist".<br />
<br />
I am very glad to be carrying on that mantle, and I am very grateful to David for helping me with my campaign. I must say that I have run out of paper with the list of people from all parts of the House who have asked me to pass on their warm wishes to Eric and David.<br />
<br />
It is traditional to talk about the history of one's constituency in a maiden speech, but I feel that those who have come before me have done a fantastic job of highlighting our rich history of Gladstone, of our proud industry--or once proud industry--of Dolly the sheep, ​of Dalkeith Palace and of Rosslyn chapel, so I would like to talk about the people of Midlothian and what I hope to do for our future.<br />
<br />
On 9 June, the day after I was elected to serve here, I spoke at a local food bank, the Food Facts Friends Project in Penicuik. I talked to Mark, who told me his personal story. He told me that when he found himself having to rely on a food bank, it did not just give him the food he needed, but gave him friendship and support and helped him to develop a network. He then helped set up and run the Penicuik food bank himself.<br />
<br />
Mark's story reminded me of an ethos that is central to charity and to the idea behind food banks, and that should be central to the work we carry out here when we talk about helping people in need: a hand up, not a handout. It is essential that we give people the tools that they need to live their lives to the full. When I have worked with people in various jobs who are receiving benefits or support from charity, that is what they want. They want support to do things for themselves, not a handout, as some Members of this House and the media might have us believe.<br />
<br />
I am sad to say that Mark had to report last week that demand for the food bank had gone up again, with more than 20 families a week using the service. He said that people who come to the foodbank because they cannot afford to feed their families may have been sanctioned or suffered from the benefit cap and welfare reform. Others simply cannot feed their family on the income of low wages and inadequate help from the Government. That is an absolute disgrace and something I will spend my time here fighting. I will fight for good jobs, for good wages, for support for our young, our elderly and people with disabilities, and for a hand up for those who fall on hard times, because it can happen to any of us.<br />
<br />
Midlothian is a strong and proud community. Yes, we come together in solidarity in times of hardship--we did it during the miners' strike, we do it when there are job losses and we have done it again now--but we also have many fantastic ways of coming together to celebrate and enjoy our community. There is the youth project that Councillor Margot Russell runs; our community radio, Black Diamond FM; and the Cousland community coffee morning, where I share a roll and a cup of tea at the weekend with members of the community. Since being elected, I have attended many children's gala days. On polling day, I gratefully received some nice soup and a roll from the Grassy Riggs café for older people and their carers. That is to name just a few. I want projects like that which bring the community together to flourish.<br />
<br />
I started my speech by paying tribute to Labour Members Eric Clarke and David Hamilton, and I will end on their wise words too. Eric ended his maiden speech by talking about "the double standards of having a few who are rich and the vast majority who are poor."<br />
<br />
David ended his speech by talking about Labour standing up for vulnerable people, saying that "those people will benefit, along with all of us, and not just a few."<br />
<br />
Although the phrase may have been stolen today by Government Members, I am going to reclaim it. I end by echoing those sentiments in saying that I am proud ​to have been elected here to represent the people of Midlothian on a platform of hope and with the message that I am joining my friends on these Benches to fight for the many, not the few. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post UK, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/p/huffingtonpostcouk-terms-of-service.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:67:"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/5412008/images/s-DANIELLE-ROWLEY-mini.jpg";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";s:6:"length";s:1:"0";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:54:"

<p>A government review into the employment of the UK&rsquo;s &ldquo;gig economy&rdquo; workers has called for better quality jobs and &ldquo;dignity at work&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>The Taylor Review, headed up by Tony Blair&rsquo;s former advisor Matthew Taylor, sets out a number of recommendations to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; people working for companies such as Uber and Deliveroo.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;The review calls on the government to adopt the ambition that all work should be fair and decent with scope for fulfilment and development,&rdquo; Taylor said.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/taylor-review-gig-economy-workers_uk_5963692be4b0d5b458ebc1e5">Around one million Britons are believed to be employed in the &ldquo;gig economy&rdquo;, which is typified by short-term, piecemeal work.&nbsp;</a></p><br />
<p>But the report, which took nine months to produce, has been attacked as &ldquo;feeble&rdquo; by unions and employment lawyers, with critics saying it does not go far enough to protect workers from&nbsp;&ldquo;insecurity and exploitation&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>Arguing that the review is not the &ldquo;game-changer&rdquo; needed,&nbsp;TUC general secretary Frances O&rsquo;Grady said:&nbsp;&ldquo;I worry that many gig economy employers will be breathing a sigh of relief this morning.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d welcome any nuggets of good news, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like the report will shift the balance of power in the modern workplace.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>The report also came under fire from Unite leader Len McCluskey, who said that the recommendations must be backed up by legislation.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;Without fully resourced enforcement then all we have from Mr Taylor and the Government is a dog that is all bark and no bite,&rdquo; McCluskey said.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>But what does the Taylor review actually recommend?&nbsp;</p><br />
<br />
<h3>No guarantee of minimum wage for workers&nbsp;</h3><br />
<p>Much to the anger of unions and employment lawyers, the Taylor review does not suggest a guaranteed minimum wage for workers.</p><br />
<p>Instead, it recommends an opt-in system that removes workers&rsquo; right to redress over not being paid the minimum wage.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;One of the things these people value is the ability to work whenever they want to,&rdquo; Taylor told Radio 4&prime;s Today programme.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>To protect this, the report recommends that, as long as:&nbsp;</p><br />
<p><strong><em>- the average workers earns 1.2 times the minimum wage overall&nbsp;</em></strong></p><br />
<p><strong><em>- can &ldquo;genuinely&rdquo; choose to work whenever&nbsp;</em></strong></p><br />
<p><strong><em>- is aware that they won&rsquo;t be earning the minimum wage when clocking on at a specific time</em></strong></p><br />
<p>then workers will not be able to take a claim against the company for not earning the minimum wage.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>But O&rsquo;Grady said that &ldquo;reviving piece rates would be a backward step&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;We already know from union wins in the courts that Deliveroo and Uber should be paying their workforce the minimum wage now,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;What happens if an Uber or Deliveroo driver gets stuck in traffic?</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;Will they get paid less for not completing their set quota of jobs? And what does it mean for their health and safety if they&rsquo;re under pressure to meet job quotas at speed?&rdquo;</p><br />
<div class="content-list-component text">&nbsp;</div><br />
<div class="content-list-component embed-asset">&nbsp;</div><br />
<h3>&lsquo;Dependent&rsquo;&nbsp;contractors&nbsp;</h3><br />
<p>The review recommends that a new category of workers called &ldquo;dependent contractors&rdquo; should be created in an attempt to clarify the grey area between fully-employed and self-employed workers.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>The report calls for these contractors to receive holiday and sick pay.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;The main demand that people have had about platforms like Uber and Deliveroo is that people in those platforms shouldn&rsquo;t be treated as self-employed, which means they don&rsquo;t have many rights, that the employer doesn&rsquo;t have to pay national insurance,&rdquo; Taylor said.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;In the end, that has to be decided by the courts, but we&rsquo;re arguing for new legislation and I think the implication of what we are saying is pretty clearly that we support the direction that the courts are going in.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;Which is to say that if those models remain as they are, then probably those people will be defined as workers, they will get minimum wage, holiday pay and sickness pay.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><br />
<h3>No ban on zero hour contracts&nbsp;</h3><br />
<p>Despite numerous calls to ban controversial zero hour contracts - which do not guarantee workers any hours - the Taylor review has not done so.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>Speaking this morning, Taylor argued that many zero hours contract workers &ldquo;choose&rdquo; to work that way, saying &ldquo;it suits them&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>Instead, the report calls on employers to &ldquo;find ways to guarantee people more hours&rdquo;, recommending that people on zero hour contracts should have the right to request fixed hours.</p><br />
<p>Employers would then be compelled to disclose how many requests they have received and how many they have conceded.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>It also proposes a higher national minimum for non-guaranteed hours.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;So if you&rsquo;re on a zero hours contract and someone asks you to work 20 hours, you would get a higher minimum wage [than someone on a fixed hour contract]&rdquo; Taylor explained.&nbsp;</p><br />
<h3>&lsquo;Strengthened&rsquo; access to employment tribunals&nbsp;</h3><br />
<p>People considering taking a company to an employment tribunal should be given a free judgement before they pursue the case, the report suggests.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>It is hoped that this would prevent cases in which people find themselves part-way through an employment tribunal - which can be very expensive - only to be told they are not an employee or worker and therefore do not have rights.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>In addition to this, employers would also face higher penalties for aggravated breeches of worker&rsquo;s rights if they are successfully taken to tribunal more than once over the same issue.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>However, while the report has encouraged the government to tackle high tribunal fees, employees will still face them in the near future.&nbsp;</p><br />

<br />
<p>Grammar schools must do more to help children from poorer backgrounds or risk losing their public funding, according to a senior Labour MP.</p><br />
<p>Lucy Powell will use a Westminster Hall debate on Tuesday to highlight the fact that less than 3% of grammar school pupils are eligible for free school meals - the government&rsquo;s indicator of low income - compared with more than 13% across all high schools.</p><br />
<p>The Manchester Central MP, who served as shadow education secretary until June last year, will call for social mobility to be put at the heart of education policy and for state funding to be taken away from grammar schools that don&rsquo;t show proper commitment to helping disadvantaged youngsters.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;Every part of the system should be working to unleash the talents of all young people,&rdquo; she will say.</p><br />
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That means existing grammar schools must do more rather than entrenching advantage and damaging wider social mobility.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;Unless they reform admissions urgently and show a substantial boost in the numbers of low income children attending these schools within the next few years, the state should stop funding these schools.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;We should be rewarding schools that do the most for pupil progress, for the majority of pupils, whilst narrowing the attainment gap, which league tables currently fail to do adequately.&nbsp;&nbsp;League tables should be reformed with pupil progress, not simply attainment, as the key measure.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>Theresa May was forced to shelve her flagship policy on grammar schools after last month&rsquo;s election and education ministers confirmed in response to a written question from Powell that plans to introduce quotas for low income children in selective schools have also been dropped.</p><br />
<br />
<p>The government said it was&nbsp;<u></u>&ldquo;encouraged by the number of selective schools that came forward voluntarily to improve their admissions arrangements&rdquo; in response to a schools consultation.&nbsp;<u></u></p><br />
<p><u></u>But figures requested by Powell from the House of Commons library show that across England,&nbsp;<u></u>half of local authorities with fully or partially selective education systems have seen no progress made, with the proportion of free school meals children in grammar schools either stagnant or falling.</p><br />
<p>In fully selective areas, half of local areas have seen no change and many schools have barely enough low income children to make up a football team. In Lincolnshire, the proportion of free school meal children in grammar schools has reduced at a time when the local population of low income children has increased.<u></u><u></u></p><br />
<p><u></u>&ldquo;Ministers opened a debate about the future of grammar schools before the election,&rdquo; Powell said.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;They should now have the courage of their convictions and work to ensure more low income children attend these schools.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;Theresa May has asked the Labour Party for answers to tackle the problems facing our country. If Theresa May brings forward proposals to develop a concrete strategy across the life stages to embed social mobility at the heart of government I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d have the support of the whole House.&rdquo;</p><br />

That&rsquo;s the answer to one of the most Googled question about the Prime Minister right now.</p><br />
<p>Another disturbing question showing up in the top results is: &ldquo;Is Theresa May dead?&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>Maybe it was former chief whip Andrew Mitchell&rsquo;s recent comments that the Prime Minister is &ldquo;dead in the water&rdquo; that got lost in translation.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Anyway, panic not, we can thankfully confirm May is well and truly alive. Here she is welcoming Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to 10 Downing Street.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Worryingly, people really don&rsquo;t seem to be sure what political party May belongs to - with the third most Googled question right now being: &ldquo;Is Theresa May Conservative?&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>It could be her asking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and other rivals <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/theresa-may-ideas-brexit-first-anniversary_uk_5962994be4b0d5b458eb5d74?utm_hp_ref=uk">for their help to deliver Brexit</a> in her first anniversary speech that got people confused.</p><br />
<p>Hopefully people were aware of what political party May was in if they voted for her in the recent general election.</p><br />
<p>If you&rsquo;re unsure, we can <em>exclusively</em> reveal that Theresa May is the leader of the <strong>Conservative</strong> party. Yes, we are being facetious.</p><br />
<br />
<p>People are also apparently interested in whether the PM is left-handed. As pictures of her signing important documents such as the Article 50 letter in the photo above suggest, she is right-handed.</p><br />
<p>We decided to find out more batsh*t crazy most Googled questions about the whole Tory cabinet - and bring you the answers, of course.</p><br />
<h3>Is Philip Hammond related to Richard Hammond?</h3><br />
<br />
<p>Despite having the same surname, we can confirm that Chancellor Philip and the former Top Gear, now The Grand Tour TV presenter Richard are not related. It seems they share a love of baby blue polka dot material though.</p><br />
<br />
<h3>Is Boris Johnson related to the Queen?</h3><br />
<br />
<p>As bizarre as it sounds, there is good reason for this crazy-sounding question.</p><br />
<p>When the now-Foreign Secretary went on the BBC One program Who Do You Think You Are? to trace his family tree in 2008, his paternal grandmother was revealed to be a descendant of a German prince. This prince - Paul Von Wurttemberg happened to be a descendant of King George II, which means BoJo is the great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson of the 18th century monarch. And thus is actually related to HRH.</p><br />
<p>Also, Johnson&rsquo;s grandad was half-Turkish so the first most Googled question &ldquo;Is Boris Johnson Turkish?&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t too ludicrous either.</p><br />
<br />
<h3>How tall is Justine Greening?</h3><br />
<br />
<p>We have to admit, we don&rsquo;t have the answer to this one about the Education Secretary at the moment. However, we&rsquo;ll bring you the answer to this important question as soon as we can.</p><br />

<h3>Is Michael Gove standing as an MP?</h3><br />
<br />
<p>Poor Michael Gove. Looks like no-one&rsquo;s been Googling anything new since before the general election on Thursday 8 June.</p><br />
<p>Anyway, Gove <em>did&nbsp;</em>stand this year, keeping the Surrey Heath seat he has held since 2005 for another term. He was also promoted to Environment Secretary in the subsequent Cabinet reshuffle.</p><br />
<br />
<h3>Is Jeremy Corbyn vegan?</h3><br />
<br />
<p>Aside from the Tory Cabinet, there are some pretty funny questions being asked about Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour shadow cabinet.</p><br />
<p>We&rsquo;ll get back to you very soon with the most bizarre questions asked about them.</p><br />
<p>But for now, we can reveal Jezza is a vegetarian, not a vegan.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Until then...</p><br />

But sometimes people are able to rise above the noise and find common cause, even from opposite ends of the political divide.</p><br />
<p>Freedom of speech is a uniting principle that doesn&rsquo;t require a political affiliation to support it. Nonetheless it still raised eyebrows when a giant of the American Left, philosopher, author and activist Cornel West, joined forces with leading US conservative intellectual Robert P. George to defend the notion of debate, over the shutting down of the opinions of others.</p><br />
<br />
<p>They issued a joint statement after protests against a social scientist, Charles Murray, speaking at Middlebury College in Vermont, lead to a professor being injured.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;All of us should be willing - even eager - to engage with anyone who is prepared to do business in the currency of truth-seeking discourse by offering reasons, marshaling evidence, and making arguments,&rdquo; they argued.</p><br />
<p>One of the most remarkable examples of politicians reaching out across a chasm has to be from the Northern Ireland Peace Process. The differences between the Unionist and Republican sides were historic, cultural and religious, and deeply ingrained. And yet John Hume of the SDLP and David Trimble of the UUP were not only able to form a government together, they were joint recipients of the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize.</p><br />
<p>Hume declared, with great optimism: &ldquo;Over the years, the barriers of the past - the distrust and prejudices of the past - will be eroded, and a new society will evolve, a new Ireland based on agreement and respect for difference.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>It is a respect for difference that is key to solving the seemingly unsolvable problems of combining disparate opinions peacefully. Because even in those differences, there are things in common: passionate belief and a desire to protect community.</p><br />
<br />
<p>The choppy waters of peace in Northern Ireland are still turbulent but great progress had been made. It was unthinkable that the firebrand Rev. Ian Paisley would ever share oxygen with Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Martin McGuinness, let alone form a government.</p><br />
<p>However, despite being sworn enemies, they worked very well together after agreeing to share power in 2007. So well, in fact, that a deep friendship between them developed. Journalists even dubbed them &ldquo;the Chuckle Brothers&rdquo;.</p><br />
<p>McGuinness told The Independent in Ireland: &ldquo;Our relationship confounded many. Of course, our political differences continued; his allegiance was to Britain and mine to Ireland. But we were able to work effectively together in the interests of all our people.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>Theirs was a consociationalist government, whereby opposing sides recognise the dangers of division. More common are coalition governments, temporary alliances of convenience.</p><br />
<p>In Denmark, they haven&rsquo;t had a single-party government for decades. It&rsquo;s just the way they do politics there. The more divided a people, the more compromise becomes necessary and desirable for the common good. And despite the country being unable to agree on a majority government, the various voices in power preside over what surveys indicate is the happiest country in the world.</p><br />
<p>Sometimes even agreeing to disagree can bring benefits.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Belgium, with the man who finally broke the deadlock Elio Di Rupo pictured above, was unable to put together a government in 2011 and in fact took the world record for the longest elapsed time without one. However, during its hiatus from having someone in charge, the country carried on without the budget cuts that were being inflicted all over Europe.</p><br />
<p>And strangely, without a consensus to drive policy, Belgium maintained modest growth levels that surpassed France, Germany, the UK, Spain, Netherlands and the US.</p><br />
<p>Ultimately, we are social animals whose very success has been the fruit of cooperation. A future that involves conflict will never be as rosy as one that seeks to build bridges for the progress of all. We are stronger when we work towards the same goal, no matter which path we favour.</p> <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post UK, and use is subject to our <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/p/huffingtonpostcouk-terms-of-service.html/'>terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:0:"";s:4:"type";s:0:"";s:6:"length";s:1:"0";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:54:"

<p>Using Uber is not &ldquo;morally acceptable&rdquo; Labour&rsquo;s shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey has said.</p><br />
<p>Her intervention on Tuesday came as the government-ordered review into the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/taylor-review-gig-economy-workers_uk_5963692be4b0d5b458ebc1e5?utm_hp_ref=uk">employment rights of workers in the gig economy</a> was published.</p><br />
<p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4&prime;s Today programme,&nbsp;Long-Bailey said Uber was &ldquo;exploiting their workers&rdquo;.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t personally use Uber because I don&rsquo;t feel that it&rsquo;s morally acceptable, but that&rsquo;s not to say that they can&rsquo;t reform their practices,&rdquo; she said.</p><br />
<p>A spokesperson for Uber said &ldquo;millions of people rely on Uber to get around and tens of thousands of drivers use our app to make money on their own terms&rdquo;.</p><br />
<p>Theresa May will launch the report this morning with a speech billed as a reboot of her premiership following the general election.</p><br />
<p>The review, headed by Matthew Taylor, a former adviser to Tony Blair, recommended a new category of worker called a &ldquo;dependent contractor&rdquo;, and said there should be &ldquo;genuine two-way flexibility&rdquo;, giving workers additional protections.</p><br />
<p>The report by Taylor, the head of the Royal Society of Arts, said low-paid workers should not be &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; at the living wage minimum, or face insecurity.</p><br />
<p>is expected to promise that the Government will act &ldquo;to ensure that the interests of employees on traditional contracts, the self-employed and those people working in the &lsquo;gig&rsquo; economy are all properly protected&rdquo;.</p><br />
<p>But she will insist that Britain must avoid &ldquo;overbearing regulation&rdquo;, retain flexibility in the labour market and remain &ldquo;a home to innovation, new ideas and new business models&rdquo;.</p><br />
<p>Unions and employment lawyers criticised the report, which has taken nine months to produce, for doing little to help the growing number of workers in delivery and taxi firms such as Deliveroo and Uber.</p><br />
<p>TUC general secretary Frances O&rsquo;Grady said:&nbsp;&ldquo;I worry that many gig economy employers will be breathing a sigh of relief this morning.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;From what we&rsquo;ve seen, this review is not the game-changer needed to end insecurity and exploitation at work. We&rsquo;d welcome any nuggets of good news, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like the report will shift the balance of power in the modern workplace.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>The Uber spokesperson added:&nbsp;&ldquo;Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades before our app existed and with Uber they have more control. Drivers are totally free to choose if, when and where they drive with no shifts or minimum hours. In fact the main reason people say they sign up to drive with Uber is so they can be their own boss.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;Drivers using Uber made average fares of &pound;15 per hour last year after our service fee and, even after costs, the average driver took home well over the National Living Wage. We&rsquo;re also proud to have moved things on from this industry&rsquo;s cash-in-hand past since every fare is electronically recorded, traceable and transparent.&rdquo;</p><br />

<h1><strong>1. NASTY TASTE</strong></h1><br />
</div><br />
<div><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">A year since she took over as PM, it&rsquo;s Theresa May&rsquo;s big relaunch speech today. Last July as she stood outside No.10, she was full of optimistic talk and reforming zeal on behalf of &lsquo;ordinary working families&rsquo; and looking forward to a long, five-year plan (no snap election she told us repeatedly) for Brexit and beyond. On the side of the worker not the wealthy, &lsquo;red Tory Theresa&rsquo; sounded positively revolutionary.</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Today, the mood is more Hobbes than Hobsbawm, as some fear May&rsquo;s premiership will be nasty, brutish and short. The woman who first coined the phrase &lsquo;the nasty party&rsquo; is desperately trying to avoid that tag as the Conservatives struggle with a fresh race row.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://news.huffingtonpost.com/t/t-l-kjujhhy-l-y/" target="_blank">HuffPost UK&rsquo;s exclusive recording</a>&nbsp;of Anne Marie Morris&rsquo;s remarks at a Brexiteer event yesterday prompted May to remove the Tory party whip from her backbencher. The PM&rsquo;s slim DUP-dependent majority was cut by one, to just 12.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Of course, Morris is a loyalist and is unlikely to vote against the Government. Yet it&rsquo;s the damage to the Tory brand that is the real worry for many Conservatives. Jeremy Corbyn managed to mobilise the minority ethnic vote in unprecedented numbers in this year&rsquo;s election and this latest controversy risks cementing the view that some Tories are stuck in the 1950s on race. Morris claimed her &ldquo;n***** in the woodpile&rdquo; remark was &ldquo;totally unintentional&rdquo;, but apologised only for &ldquo;any offence caused&rdquo; rather than the remark itself.</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Given the damage done, it&rsquo;s hard to see how Morris can regain the Tory whip, no matter what the &lsquo;investigation&rsquo; by Tory campaigns HQ concludes. Which raises the issue of whether she will be booted out for good, and whether she would quit to trigger a by-election. Her majority in her west country seat is 17,000.&nbsp; But as this year has taught everyone, electoral norms can be upended.</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Morris had already been forced to distance herself from her electoral agent and partner Roger Kendrick last month, after he claimed &ldquo;that the crisis in education was due entirely to non-British born immigrants and their high birth rates&rsquo;.&rdquo; Kemi Badenoch, the Tory MP for Saffron Walden, told the Telegraph she spoke to the Chief Whip &ldquo;to express my dismay, and I am pleased that decisive action has been taken&rdquo;. Maidstone MP Helen Grant said she was &ldquo;so ashamed&rdquo; that a fellow Tory could use the phrase without knowing its history (and it&rsquo;s an awful history) or impact.</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Way back in 1978, Labour Foreign Secretary David Owen used the woodpile phrase, but it was a Tory MP who at the time condemned his &ldquo;deporable&rdquo; comment. And Anne Marie Morris is only 60, so can&rsquo;t claim this is a &lsquo;generational&rsquo; issue. Theresa May is also 60 - and told us on the steps of No.10 last July she wanted to end the &ldquo;burning injustice&rdquo; of a criminal justice system where &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re black, you&rsquo;re treated more harshly&rdquo;. One year on, like much of the rest of that speech, those words look very different now.</p><br />

<h1><strong>2. GIGGER BITES</strong></h1><br />
</div><br />
<div><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Yesterday the PM&rsquo;s de facto deputy Damian Green suggested May would announce something bold in response to Matthew Taylor&rsquo;s report into the &lsquo;gig economy&rsquo;. From the overnight extracts of her speech, it&rsquo;s hard to see anything bold, with mere bromides that &lsquo;this Government will act&rsquo; to protect workers. She even praises the flexibility of firms like Uber and Deliveroo.</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">What&rsquo;s really new is Taylor&rsquo;s call for such firms to pay National Insurance (the firms, not their staff, note) and an end to the &lsquo;cash in hand&rsquo; economy for the self-employed (the Government won&rsquo;t uncork-the-Gauke on that one I suspect). The TUC&rsquo;s Frances O&rsquo;Grady and GMB&rsquo;s Tim Roache both fear Taylor has caved to corporate interests when he should have urged the outright abolition of zero hours contracts. Labour&rsquo;s Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told Today she doesn&rsquo;t use Uber because it was &ldquo;morally unacceptable&rdquo;.</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Taylor, a former policy chief for Tony Blair, was commissioned precisely because he&rsquo;s a blue skies thinker. But unions may not be happy with the Times draft of his report which suggests he will suggest social media like Twitter is as powerful a tool as unions for lobbying for harassed workers.</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">A draft report seen by The Times suggests that he will not recommend any of these. It also appears to sideline the labour movement. &ldquo;The combination of social media and other online forms of communication with an absence of formalised trade union organisation appears to open up the potential for increasing the collective voice of self-employed individuals operating in some parts of the &lsquo;gig economy&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><br />

<h1 class="size-26" lang="x-size-26"><strong>3. UP AND ATOM</strong></h1><br />
</div><br />
<div><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Fears of &lsquo;Brexit backsliding&rsquo; is now very much a thing among Tory Eurosceptics (who have already christened their arch enemies as &lsquo;reversers&rsquo;). And their worries won&rsquo;t have been eased by Damian Green&rsquo;s remarks yesterday when he suggested the UK could still be signed up to the European Court of Justice in a transition phase beyond 2019. His comments signalled for the first time that the PM&rsquo;s deep &lsquo;red line&rsquo; on this issue could in fact be more a lilac pink, or rubbed out altogether.</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">And it&rsquo;s the ECJ&rsquo;s role in monitoring the EU-wide Euratom treaty governing the movement of nuclear material that is causing most trouble right now. The PM was in &lsquo;nothing has changed&rsquo; Maybot mode in the Commons, insisting the UK could have a Swiss-style close cooperation with the atomic body. Yet even Dom Cummings, the outspoken former Vote Leave chief, tweeted that only Government &lsquo;morons&rsquo; wanted to quit Euratom (he warned the idea &ldquo;must be ditched or she will be&rdquo;).</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">George Osborne&rsquo;s Evening Standard had a &lsquo;CANCER PATIENTS IN BREXIT SCARE&rsquo; headline, as a leading radiologist said pulling out of the treaty would threaten the import of isotopes needed for treatment. In keeping with recent tradition, Osborne&rsquo;s leader column had another nugget: David Davis and Greg Clark were overruled by May in Cabinet when they suggested staying in Euratom. Osborne&rsquo;s editorial actually tried to goad DD into a leadership challenge. Davis and Osborne have never been close, however. I recall the ex-Chancellor joking soon after 2010 that Davis should be given a Government job: as envoy to Kabul.</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">The Guardian reports the Government is drawing up plans to replicate the benefits of remaining a member of the Euratom treaty, as nine Tory MPs warned they could rebel on the issue. It also has something to cheer No.10: Brussels sources say staying in Euratom is impossible once you quit the EU. So it&rsquo;s all about the nuance of transition, again.</p><br />

<h1><strong>4. HEY TEACHER, LEAVE THOSE QUIDS ALONE</strong></h1><br />
</div><br />
<div><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">The teachers&rsquo; pay review body was published yesterday. It had some strong words, warning of &ldquo;a substantial risk&rdquo; to the public education system if wages were capped for much longer. Yet it gave the Government some breathing space by ultimately recommending a 1% rise in line with the Treasury cap.</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">For Theresa May, that was just a matter of lucky timing. The teachers review body completed its report before the PM&rsquo;s election disaster prompted calls from her own ministers and MPs for the cap to be lifted. The body was also acting in accordance with the remit handed to it. Teachers&rsquo; pay rises start in September, not April like some other public sector workers, and there was little time to get real change.</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Still, that didn&rsquo;t dampen the anger felt by teachers who felt the continuing freeze was &ldquo;an insult&rdquo;. And the real focus now is on the &lsquo;remit letter&rsquo; due to be sent to the NHS pay review body by Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss ahead of its recommendations due early in 2018. The letter is usually sent in July before the Commons summer recess (it was sent on July 13 last year), but will we get it this month? Or will it be sent when MPs are away?</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Chancellor Philip Hammond is already &pound;2bn out of pocket from his cancelled National Insurance rise and has to find &pound;1bn for Northern Ireland. The Times says Justine Greening is looking at winding down expensive plans to build more Free Schools in order to fund her &pound;4bn pledge for more cash for all schools. Meanwhile at the chalkface, the Guardian reports primary pupils have been<a href="http://news.huffingtonpost.com/t/t-l-kjujhhy-l-t/" target="_blank">&nbsp;marked down in tests for misshapen commas</a>. No, really.</p><br />

<h1><strong>5. END TO END STUFF</strong></h1><br />
</div><br />
<div><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Over in the US, Donald Trump&rsquo;s links to the Kremlin face increasing scrutiny amid claims his son knew of Russian attempts to discredit Hillary Clinton. No wonder Trump had to swiftly disown plans for a joint US-Russia cyber security unit after an outcry from Republicans. (In other news, SkyNews reports Trump&rsquo;s state visit to the UK has been put back to next year)</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">But here in the UK, it looks like another of May&rsquo;s pet policies &ndash; forcing WhatsApp and other firms to hand over encrypted messages - may well be doomed by a combination of tight Commons majority and expert opinion. The PM has strong DUP backing for her counter-terror strategy overall but more than a handful of civil liberties Tory MPs now have the ammo they need to vote against any legislation cracking down on encryption.</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Why? Because Robert Hannigan, the former head of GCHQ, yesterday ridiculed Home Secretary Amber Rudd&rsquo;s threat to pass new laws to build &ldquo;back doors&rdquo; into secret messages. &ldquo;Encryption is an overwhelmingly good thing - it keeps us all safe and secure. Building in back doors is a threat to everybody and it&rsquo;s not a good idea to weaken security for everybody to tackle a minority. I don&rsquo;t think there is a magic solution where you can just legislate it away.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p class="size-17" lang="x-size-17">Words like those will make it very difficult to get such a move through Parliament. Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that three MPs had their email accounts compromised by the recent cyber attack on Parliament. Not having a secure email password looks like an open back door indeed.</p><br />

<p>Women over 50 can expect to spend nearly six years of their later life caring for a friend or relative, new figures show.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>The Office for National Statistics estimated the average amount of life spent as an unpaid carer by analysing life expectancy and census data, which reveals women who reach 50 are likely to spend 5.9 years of the rest of their life as carers, while men spend a year less.</p><br />
<p>During the 2015/16 financial year, 8% of the UK&rsquo;s private household population said they were &ldquo;informal carers&rdquo; for someone, according to government data and of those, nearly two thirds were women.</p><br />
<p>Charities slammed the findings as evidence of &lsquo;a social care system on its knees&rsquo; and said society remains heavily reliant on people&rsquo;s dedication to their loved ones.</p><br />
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Dominic Carter, senior policy officer at the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society, said:&nbsp;&ldquo;These figures show the incredible dependency society has on the hundreds of thousands of unpaid carers for people with dementia across the UK.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;They also demonstrate the inordinate and unfair strain they are put under to prop up the broken social care system. Without devoted relatives and friends, many of the most vulnerable people in society would miss out on vital care, and instead be at the mercy of a system on its knees.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;Years of cuts to social care budgets has led to our dementia care system facing the very real risk of collapse. The promised consultation on social care reform must deliver a long-term solution that creates a fair and transparent division of responsibility between government and the individual, and share the cost of care more equally across society.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>Carers UK, which lobbies for unpaid carers, said its own research shows 40% of unpaid carers have not had a break in the last year,&nbsp;while one in four had not had a single day off in five years.&nbsp;</p><br />
<br />
<p>&nbsp;Chief executive Hel&eacute;na Herklots said:&nbsp;&ldquo;People are living longer with multiple health issues and this is creating a demand for care and support that health and care services are failing to meet.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;The result is increased expectations on families and friends to step in to help. More and more of us are providing care for an older, disabled or ill loved one, yet even a few hours caring a week can result in having to cut down hours or give up work, bringing devastating and irreversible consequences for long term financial security.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;Carers tell us this is mainly due to the difficulty and exhaustion of juggling work and family responsibilities without the right support from local care services and employers.&rdquo;</p><br />
<p>She said the latest ONS statistics were further proof that women are more likely to bear the burden of looking after someone&nbsp;- costing the general workforce valuable skills and experience - and has lobbied for better employment rights for carers.</p><br />
<p>When the right support from employers&rsquo; and local services is in place, it&rsquo;s a triple win for carers, business and society,&rdquo; she added.</p><br />
<p>&ldquo;As our population ages, growing numbers of people will be juggling work and care, particularly in later life and society and public services must adapt to support them.&rdquo;</p><br />

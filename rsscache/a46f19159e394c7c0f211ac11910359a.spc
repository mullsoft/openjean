<p>BepiColombo is an impressive mission, jointly owned by the European and Japanese space agencies (ESA and JAXA). A European “<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs21grc.html">ion-drive unit</a>” (MTM, Mercury Transfer Module) will propel the assembly during its seven-year cruise before achieving orbit about the sun’s nearest planet. It will fly close past Mercury after less than three years, but will have to continue orbiting the sun, making five more flybys of Mercury – using its gravitational attraction to help it match velocity with the planet so that it can be captured into orbit about the planet itself. </p>

<p>Once in orbit, the Japanese component of the mission, the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter, MMO, will be set spinning (for stability) and be released into an eccentric orbit to study the magnetic field, dust and environment of charged particles surrounding the planet. The European orbiter, known as the Mercury Planetary Orbiter, will then lower itself into a more circular orbit optimised for study of the planet’s surface and interior. </p>

<h2>Doing science in a pizza oven</h2>

<p>The technological challenges of then operating the two vehicles in orbit extend far beyond the sheer “rocket science” of getting there. Mercury is three times closer to the sun than the Earth is, so the spacecraft will be heated by direct sunlight nearly ten times stronger than that experienced above the Earth’s atmosphere. Worse, when flying above the day-side of planet, the orbiter will be baked on its underside by “pizza-oven heat” from Mercury’s searing 400°C surface only 500km below.</p>

          </figure>

<p>Parts of the spacecraft’s insulated outer surface may reach 380°C at times, but the sensitive electronics inside need to be kept below about -40°C to function properly. Part of the solution has been to fit the orbiter with the splendidly-named “cold finger” – essentially a metal rod which conducts heat from its innards out to where it can be dumped into space via a “venetian blind” radiator panel. The spacecraft’s orientation will be controlled at all times, so that the slats of the panel will never allow direct sunlight or the radiation from the hot planet to fall on the radiator surface.</p>

<p>This effort scarcely needs to be justified to scientists who are <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-more-we-learn-about-mercury-the-weirder-it-seems-55972">greatly puzzled</a> by what the two previous missions to Mercury – Mariner 10 (1970s) and Messenger (2011-15) – have found.</p>

<p>NASA’s <a href="https://theconversation.com/after-ten-years-spacecraft-will-end-life-as-just-another-crater-on-mercurys-surface-39484">MESSENGER mission</a> revealed that the planet’s surface is surprisingly rich in “volatile” elements such as sulphur, chlorine, sodium and potassium. We would expect these to have been preferentially lost during the hot or violent birth that a planet so close to the sun should have had. Add this to the fact that Mercury’s rocky shell is strangely thin compared to the Earth’s and overlies a disproportionately large iron core, and its very nature poses a conundrum.</p>

<p>It may have originated much further from the sun than we now find it, and suffered a <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/space/new-hypothesis-mercury%E2%80%99s-unusual-formation/">rock-stripping collision</a> during inward migration.</p>

<figure>
            <iframe width="440" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EcmyITXgL4M?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            
          </figure>

<p>Other questions include why part of Mercury’s core is still molten and able to generate a magnetic field and why the planet shows so much evidence of past volcanic eruptions.</p>

<h2>Cost and benefits</h2>

<p>Whenever there is a report about a space mission it is usual to see comments from readers bemoaning the waste of money, arguing it ought to have been spent on relieving suffering here on Earth. We can all sympathise with the sentiment, but to single out the costs of space research for censure in this regard lacks a sense of proportion. </p>

<p>BepiColombo has cost ESA and JAXA about €1.65 billion between them, not bad for such a complex project, and individual national funding agencies may have spent about the same total again for salaries and instrument development. All this money has been spent on Earth, helping the economy – it hasn’t been somehow shot into space and lost. And in any case new space technology has been shown to open the way for developments such as <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/research/main/news/rosetta-crashing-still-save-lives-earth">prostate cancer “sniffer devices”</a> and much more. </p>

<p>Also, let’s not forget that our civilisation disposes of far more of its surplus wealth on entertainment and what might be termed “unnecessary fripperies” than on space research. For example, the annual <a href="http://www.cityam.com/237030/f1-team-budgets-ferrari-have-more-money-to-work-with-than-anyone-else-but-mercedes-get-best-bang-for-their-buck">budgets of the four largest Formula One motor racing teams</a> exceed the <em>total</em> cost to ESA and JAXA for the BepiColombo mission, as do yearly <a href="https://www.cosmeticsbusiness.com/news/article_page/Global_lipstick_sales_set_to_sparkle_through_to_2019/115753">global sales of lipstick</a>.</p>

<p>So I’m looking ahead to BepiColombo’s findings with a clear conscience. There are many things it can tell us about our part of the solar system. And, perhaps most importantly, it could inspire future generations to take an interest in science.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80687/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>Columba is the Irish monk who became the most important Scottish saint of his era. He founded a monastery in 563AD on Iona, an island off the west coast of Scotland, which <a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/iona-abbey-and-nunnery/">became</a> one of the leading intellectual and artistic centres of northern Europe. With the help of stories about miracles such as the one above, Columba is often credited with converting Scotland’s pagan Picts to Christianity. </p>

<p>A vital part of Columba’s legend is the writing hut or monastic cell where he is said to have copied scriptures and received students. But despite previous efforts to prove its existence, archaeologists had long believed the evidence was not available – and that little or nothing remains of Columba’s time. </p>

<p>We have been able to show otherwise. This is the story of how colleagues and I found compelling evidence that Columba’s hut really did exist, completing what a great team of archaeologists started decades earlier. </p>

<h2>Digging for glory</h2>

<p>Columba’s monastery stood on Iona until it was replaced at the beginning of the 1200s by the Benedictine abbey that remains today. The iconic “Celtic” <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/767104">ringed high cross</a> was created here, and maybe also the <a href="http://www.visitdublin.com/see-do/details/book-of-kells">Book of Kells</a>, a famous manuscript of the Gospels. The place came to be so holy that generations of Scottish and Irish and even Norwegian kings <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/iona/">are buried</a> nearby. </p>

<p>Our main source of information about Columba is his biography <a href="http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/columba-e.asp">Vita Sancti Columbae</a>, written in 697AD by his successor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adomn%C3%A1n">Adomnán</a>. Produced a century after Columba’s death, it describes Iona as a pilgrimage landscape. It tells of important moments from Columba’s life whose locations are now marked with crosses, while his grave was marked with the stone he apparently used as a pillow. </p>

<p>Adomnán describes both Columba’s writing hut or “tegoriolum” and his lodging (“hospitiolum”), where the saint slept and also trained disciples. Both were settings for miracles and prophetic visions, and may in fact be the same place. </p>

<p>The hut is specifically described as being on a raised place looking east out over the Sound of Iona to the rocks of Mull. There is a rocky outcrop within the monastic core of the site known as Tòrr an Aba (“the mound of the abbot”) which fits the description perfectly. Standing there today, one looks out over impossibly blue water out to the pink granite of the neighbouring island of Mull. It certainly feels like a good place to ponder divinity and receive the occasional angelic visitor.</p>

<p>Just over 60 years ago, a team of archaeologists was invited to Iona to find out if anything survived of the monastery. All in their twenties, they were led by <a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/staff/community/people/bereavements/2016/professor-charles-thomas">Charles Thomas</a>, who would become the premier scholar of early Christianity in Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p>One of the first places they investigated was Tòrr an Aba. The rocky mound was overgrown with grass, but there were antiquarian reports of a cross having stood there. The team quickly located the socket for a cross and noticed it was built over an earlier structure. </p>

<p>In 1957 they exposed this area and found the remains of a small <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCKkHqlx9dE">wattle hut</a>. The burned down structure had been buried under pebbles, and the cross base had been set up over it.</p>

<p>Thomas reviewed the evidence and contacted historians to discuss the possibility that this was indeed Columba’s hut. Today, archaeologists would collect samples of the burned wood for radiocarbon dating, but this was not widely available in the 1950s. Nonetheless, the excavators did take samples. </p>

<p>For various reasons, Thomas never published his work. The excavators of the hut, Peter and Elizabeth Fowler, would publish <a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_118/118_181_201.pdf">their findings</a> in 1988, but by that point the samples were missing. They made the best case they could, saying they believed but couldn’t prove it was Columba’s hut. The consensus became that the remains of Columba’s time on Iona were perhaps too fragmentary to prove.</p>

<h2>Second coming</h2>

<p>Fast forward to 2012. Historic Scotland, predecessor of <a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot">Historic Environment Scotland</a>, now managed the site. I was helping renew its displays along with researchers at the University of Glasgow – the historian <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/staff/katherineforsyth/">Katherine Forsyth</a> was researching the collection of carved stones, while <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/staff/ewancampbell/">Ewan Campbell</a> researched the archaeological background. </p>

<p>It became apparent that Thomas’ unpublished excavations were crucial to both investigations. At 84, Thomas agreed to transfer his Iona archive to Historic Scotland. I was lucky enough to meet him in his home in Truro to collect boxes of material which had lain in his garage since his retirement.</p>

<p>After rigorous detective work generously funded by Historic Environment Scotland, Ewan Campbell and I finally sorted out the scattered notes, drawings and photographs into a data structure report describing each trench and its contents. Amongst this material was a wonderful surprise – small boxes of charcoal, including some marked “Cutting 10” – the trench containing the wooden hut. </p>

<p>Charles Thomas sadly died in 2016 before we got the results. The radiocarbon lab at <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/suerc/">Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre</a> has confirmed that two samples of hazel charcoal from the hut dated from between AD 540 and AD 650, likely to be from the lifetime of St Columba. Later marked by a cross, the hut was almost certainly his.</p>

<p>Exciting as this is for me as an archaeologist of early Christianity, perhaps more exciting is to vindicate Charles Thomas, whose work continues to inspire my research. The consensus about Iona is being overturned thanks to Thomas’ work. Now we are going to see what else he may have found.

Surely this has little to do with mathematical models which are so frequently associated with cold and rational logic. So what can maths tell us about this powerful phenomenon closely connected to the emotions? Can mathematics help us measure what’s sublime or ineffable about a piece of music?</p>

<p>Music evokes strong emotions such as <a href="http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2008-2009/Huron/HuronFrisson.pdf">frisson</a> (goose bumps), awe and laughter – and has been found to use the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep41952">same reward pathways as food, drugs and sex</a> to induce pleasure. A shiver down one’s spine or an uncontrollable guffaw when listening to music is most often a case of the music defying your expectations. Expectations can be defined in two ways: schematic – knowing how a genre of music is supposed to go – or veridical – knowing how a particular piece of music unfolds.</p>

<p>On one end of the spectrum, a performance or a piece of music that does just what you’d expect runs the risk of becoming banal. On the other end, music like that of <a href="https://www.schickele.com/">PDQ Bach</a> – which uses tongue-in-cheek egregious violations of known expectations – makes many people laugh.</p>

<p>The craving that comes from musical anticipation and the euphoria that follows the reward have both been found to be linked to <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n2/full/nn.2726.html">dopamine release</a>. As a result, performers and composers alike play with listeners’ expectations, often going to great lengths to carefully <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lp07ZMAczT8C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=tendency+and+expectation+in+music+leonard+meyer+emotion+and+meaning+in+music&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0u_2spZXUAhWKIcAKHQyNDp0Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=tendency%20and%20expectation%20in%20music%20leonard%20meyer%20emotion%20and%20meaning%20in%20music&amp;f=false">choreograph their expectations</a>, and then sometimes breaking them, to provoke and heighten emotional responses. </p>

<h2>Playing with expectations</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/6401/whats-the-difference-between-modal-music-and-tonal-music">tonal music</a>, which is almost all of the music that we hear and can be thought of as being based on a scale, the note sequence sets up expectations, then suspends, fulfils, or violates them. For a simple example, sing the first three phrases of “Happy Birthday” and stop at the end of the penultimate phrase.</p>

<p><audio preload="metadata" controls="controls" data-duration="13" data-image="" data-title="Happy Birthday (first part)" data-size="290510" data-source="EC" data-source-url="" data-license="Author provided" data-license-url="">

      </div></p>

<p>Anticipation for the resolution to this musical cliffhanger creates a palpable knot in the gut. This hollow feeling can be further intensified by delaying the final phrase. The release is evident when the final phrase is heard and ends happily on the most stable tone.</p>

<p><audio preload="metadata" controls="controls" data-duration="7" data-image="" data-title="Happy Birthday (second part)" data-size="159256" data-source="EC" data-source-url="" data-license="Author provided" data-license-url="">

<p>Two things are at work here in this miniature example: tonality and time. Tonality provides a framework through which expectations are formed – and the play on time, the delaying of expectations, uses the framework to create a musical cliffhanger and titillate the senses.</p>

<h2>Where maths comes in</h2>

<p>Expectations can be modelled mathematically and time can be measured – so the shaping of both expectations and time can be described in numbers. Over the years, in my research lab, we have developed models and computer algorithms for quantifying tonal properties and expressive parameters in music. Many of the tonal analysis algorithms are based on what is known as a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_array_model">spiral array model</a>”. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461494744">spiral array</a> can be plotted in 3D to allow us to visualise the dynamic evolution of musical keys and spot when the notes and their timing combine to do something interesting to tug at our emotions.</p>

          </figure>

<p>As music is heard, the notes can be mapped to the model, duly weighted and summarised as points inside it. Movements in the space inside the model allow listeners to see deviations from expected tonal behaviour.</p>

          </figure>

<h2>Musical tension</h2>

<p>Just as pitches that sound close one to another are spatially near each other; the converse is true: pitches that sound far from one another are spatially far apart. Feelings of tension translate to quantifiably big distances – notes mapping to widely dispersed points or pulling far away from an established centre of gravity.</p>

<p>Composers actively vary the tension over time to generate interest and captivate the listener’s attention. The shaping of tension over time also helps create meaningful long-term structure. It is notoriously hard for computer algorithms to generate music with long-term structure. But the MorpheuS system, developed by music researcher Dorien Herremans, circumvents this problem to <a href="http://dorienherremans.com/MorpheuS">generate music with a pre-set narrative structure</a> by using a tension model based on the spiral array. Listen to this version of JS Bach’s “Minuet in D”:</p>

      </div></p>

<p>It follows the tension profile, rhythms, and repetition patterns of the original piece from A Little Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach:</p>

      </div></p>

<p>The notes of the generated piece also conjures up similar degrees of tension to the original music. For example, discordant sounds follows the same patterns of discord in Bach’s original piece.</p>

<h2>Tipping points</h2>

<p>Not only do notes themselves create tension, a performer can delay resolutions to heighten suspense. Judicious use of timing is one of the most potent expressive devices for eliciting emotional responses. The right amount of delay can sweeten the anticipation – but take too much time and the performer risks losing the listener. </p>

<p>In music with a beat, the musical pulse forms a baseline grid on which to measure timing deviations – prolongations and reductions of the time unit. In extreme cases, these warpings of musical time produce <a href="http://mp.ucpress.edu/content/33/3/344">tipping points</a>, the feeling of being poised at the brink of an abstract hill in an imaginary roller coaster.</p>

<p>We can use maths to present this graphically. When a piece of music is performed precisely as written, it is displayed as a flat line in these graphs. But music is almost never played exactly as written. Performers often exercise significant creative license; as a result, anomalous peaks signal the evocation of musical tipping points.</p>

<p>By elongating specific notes – or words or syllables – the performer draws the listener’s ears to details that might have been missed or glossed over. Because the listener often knows what’s coming, the delay prolongs expectation – creating drama and exaggerating emotional cues.</p>

<p>Mathematics is the language through which scientists understand the nature of the universe. However, the extent to which numbers can explain the ephemeral experience of music has yet to be fully explored. Why does music move us? How do its variegated structures translate to musical expectations? How do performers and composers exploit these expectations to craft profound and moving musical experiences? Our mathematical forays into these questions are but the tip of the ice berg.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/74876/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>The great auk, <em>Pinguinus impennis</em>, was a large, black and white bird that was found in huge numbers across the North Atlantic Ocean. It was often mistaken to be a member of the penguin family, but its closest living relative is actually the razorbill, and it is related to puffins, guillemots and murres.</p>

<p>Being flightless, the great auk was particularly vulnerable to hunting. Humans killed the birds in their thousands for meat, oil and feathers. By the start of the 19th dentury, the north-west Atlantic populations had been decimated, and the last few remaining breeding birds were to be found on the islands off the south-west coast of Iceland. But these faced another threat: due to their scarcity, the great auk had become a desirable item for both private and institutional collections. </p>

<h2>The fateful voyage of 1844</h2>

<p>Between 1830 and 1841 several trips were taken to Iceland’s Eldey Island, to catch, kill, and sell the birds for exhibitions. Following a period of no reported captures, great auk dealer Carl Siemsen commissioned an expedition to Eldey to search for any remaining birds. </p>

<p>Between June 2-5 1844, 14 men set sail in an eight-oared boat for the island. Three braved the dangerous landing and spotted two great auks among the smaller birds that also bred there. A chase began but the birds ran at a slow pace, their small wings extended, expressing no call of alarm. They were caught with relative ease and killed, their egg, broken in the hunt, was discarded. </p>

<p>But the birds – a male and a female – were never to reach Siemsen. The expedition leader sold them to a man named Christian Hansen, who then sold them on to Herr Möller, an apothecary in Reykjavik. Möller skinned the birds and sent them, and their preserved body parts, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1861.tb08857.x/full">to Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>The internal organs of these two birds now reside in the <a href="http://cphpost.dk/history/copenhagen-shrine-of-the-great-auk.html">Natural History Museum of Denmark</a>. The skins, however were lost track of, and – despite considerable effort by <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C6uUBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP5&amp;lpg=PP5&amp;dq=ISBN+978-1-108-08147-4&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XB5VaGOBsK&amp;sig=qkWYdRER2AedJdfCcvy9VNV7QQA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjk5Jegxf7UAhVkLsAKHW1gCIQQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ISBN%20978-1-108-08147-4&amp;f=false">numerous scholars</a> – their location has remained unknown.</p>

<h2>Missing skins</h2>

<p>In 1999, great auk expert Errol Fuller proposed a <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Great_Auk.html?id=GFQXAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">list of candidate specimens</a>, the origins of which were not known, which he believed could be from the last pair of great auks. But how to find which of these were the true skins? For this we turned to the field of ancient DNA (aDNA).</p>

<p>In the last 30 years, aDNA technology has progressed greatly, and has been used to address a wide range of ecological and evolutionary questions, providing insight into countless species’ pasts, including humans. Museum specimens play a key role in aDNA research and have been used to solve several issues of unidentified or misidentified specimens – for example <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440314004051">Greenlandic Norse fur</a>, <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03036758.2012.732585">rare kiwi specimens</a>, <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03036758.2014.972962">Aukland island shags</a>, and <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/12/01/rspb.2009.1837.short">mislabelled penguin samples</a>.</p>

<p>We took things a step further, using aDNA techniques and a detective-like approach to try and <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/8/6/164">resolve the mystery</a> of what happened to the skins of the last two great auks.</p>

<h2>Ancient DNA</h2>

<p>We sampled the organs from the last birds, along with candidate specimens from <a href="http://www.uebersee-museum.de/en/">Brussels, Belgium</a>; <a href="http://www.naturundmensch.de/">Oldenburg</a> and <a href="http://www.zoologisches-museum.uni-kiel.de/index.php">Kiel</a>, in Germany; and <a href="https://nhm.org/site/">Los Angeles</a>. We then extracted and sequenced the mitochondrial genomes from each, and compared the sequences from the candidate skins to those from that came from the organs of the last pair.</p>

<p>The results showed that the skin held in the museum in Brussels was a perfect match for the oesophagus from the male bird. Unfortunately, there was no match between the other candidate skins and the female’s organs. </p>

<p>The specimens from Brussels and Los Angeles were thought to be the most likely candidates due to their history: both birds were in the hands of a well-known great auk dealer, Israel of Copenhagen, in 1845. As the bird in Brussels was a match, we thought it likely that the one in Los Angeles would also be a match for the female’s organs. It was surprising when it wasn’t. However, our research led us to speculate that a mix up which occurred following the death of Captain Vivian Hewitt in 1965 – who owned four birds which are now in Cardiff, Birmingham, Los Angeles and Cincinnati – was not resolved as once thought.</p>

<p>The identity of the birds now in Birmingham and Cardiff <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Great_Auk.html?id=GFQXAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">are now known</a> after photographs were used to identify them – but those in Los Angeles and Cincinnati have been harder to determine. It was thought that their identities could be found from annotated photographs taken in 1871, but we speculate that they were not correctly identified, and that the bird in Cincinnati may be the original bird from Israel of Copenhagen. If this is the case, then it could explain why the Los Angeles bird fails to match with either of the last great auk organs held in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>We now have permission to test the great auk specimen in the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History and Science, and hopefully solve this final piece of a centuries-old puzzle. There is no guarantee that this bird will be a match either, but if it is, we will finally know what happened to the last two specimens of the extinct great auk.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80650/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

            </span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Shutterstock</span></span></figcaption></figure><p>How do you stop a robot from hurting people? Many existing robots, such as those assembling cars in factories, shut down immediately when a human comes near. But this quick fix wouldn’t work for something like a self-driving car that might have to move to avoid a collision, or a care robot that might need to catch an old person if they fall. With robots set to become our servants, companions and co-workers, we need to deal with the increasingly complex situations this will create and the ethical and safety questions this will raise.</p>

<p>Science fiction already envisioned this problem and has suggested various potential solutions. The most famous was author Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics, which are designed to prevent robots harming humans. But since 2005, my colleagues and I at the University of Hertfordshire, have been working on <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004018">an idea</a> that could be an alternative. </p>

<p>Instead of laws to restrict robot behaviour, we think robots should be empowered to maximise the possible ways they can act so they can pick the best solution for any given scenario. As we describe in a new paper <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frobt.2017.00025/full">in Frontiers</a>, this principle could form the basis of a new set of universal guidelines for robots to keep humans as safe as possible.</p>

<h2>The Three Laws</h2>

<p>Asimov’s Three Laws are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
<li>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
<li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</li>
</ul>

<p>While these laws sound plausible, <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/why-asimovs-three-laws-of-robotics-cant-protect-us-1553665410">numerous arguments</a> have demonstrated why they are inadequate. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Robot">Asimov’s own stories</a> are arguably a deconstruction of the laws, showing how they repeatedly fail in different situations. <a href="https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/themes/engineering/activities/principlesofrobotics/">Most attempts</a> to draft <a href="https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles">new guidelines</a> follow a similar principle to create safe, compliant and robust robots.</p>

<p>One problem with any explicitly formulated robot guidelines is the need to translate them into a format that robots can work with. Understanding the full range of human language and the experience it represents is a very hard job for a robot. Broad behavioural goals, such as preventing harm to humans or protecting a robot’s existence, can mean different things in <a href="https://theconversation.com/after-75-years-isaac-asimovs-three-laws-of-robotics-need-updating-74501">different contexts</a>. Sticking to the rules might end up leaving a robot helpless to act as its creators might hope.</p>

<figure class="align-center ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/177530/width754/file-20170710-23474-1ywk3bs.jpg">

          </figure>

<p>Our alternative concept, empowerment, stands for the opposite of helplessness. Being empowered means having the ability to affect a situation and being aware that you can. We have been developing ways to translate this social concept into a quantifiable and operational technical language. This would endow robots with the drive to keep their options open and act in a way that increases their influence on the world.</p>

<p>When we tried simulating how robots would use the empowerment principle in various scenarios, we found they would often act in surprisingly “natural” ways. It typically only requires them to model how the real world works but doesn’t need any specialised artificial intelligence programming designed to deal with the particular scenario.</p>

<p>But to keep people safe, the robots need to try to maintain or improve human empowerment as well as their own. This essentially means being protective and supportive. Opening a locked door for someone would increase their empowerment. Restraining them would result in a short-term loss of empowerment. And significantly hurting them could remove their empowerment altogether. At the same time, the robot has to try to maintain its own empowerment, for example by ensuring it has enough power to operate and it does not get stuck or damaged.</p>

<h2>Robots could adapt to new situations</h2>

<p>Using this general principle rather than predefined rules of behaviour would allow the robot to take account of the context and evaluate scenarios no one has previously envisaged. For example, instead of always following the rule “don’t push humans”, a robot would generally avoid pushing them but still be able to push them out of the way of a falling object. The human might still be harmed but less so than if the robot didn’t push them.</p>

<p>In the film I, Robot, based on several Asimov stories, robots create an oppressive state that is supposed to minimise the overall harm to humans by keeping them confined and “protected”. But our principle would avoid such a scenario because it would mean a loss of human empowerment.</p>

<p>While empowerment provides a new way of thinking about safe robot behaviour, we still have much work to do on scaling up its efficiency so it can easily be deployed on any robot and translate to good and safe behaviour in all respects. This poses a very difficult challenge. But we firmly believe empowerment can lead us towards a practical solution to the ongoing and highly debated problem of how to rein in robots’ behaviour, and how to keep robots -– in the most naive sense -– “ethical”.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80569/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

It creates a sense of who we are, allows us to plan for the future and helps us form relationships. But we don’t all remember our past in the same way. In fact, the nature and quality of memory differs considerably between people. </p>

<p>For instance, when asked to remember something about a party, one person might describe vividly their sixth birthday: how the gifts were laid out, the sweet, chocolatey taste of the hedgehog cake and going to bed really late. Another person might not recall this precise detail, but remember that their aunt despised parties and that hedgehog cakes were <a href="https://pinkscharming.com/make-do/recipes/classic-80s-cake-harriet-hedgehog-how-to/">massive in the 80s</a>.</p>

<p>So, our personal memories contain different types of information. Some of this is very specific about when and where things happened – and what it felt like. This collection of personal experiences is known as “episodic memory”. Other bits are general facts about the world, ourselves and the people we know. This is called “semantic memory”. A big question in neuroscience is whether these two memory types involve distinct parts of the brain.</p>

<p>Individuals who have suffered damage to a region called the hippocampus (involved in memory, learning and emotion) have been found to remember facts about their lives but lack the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15716139">high-resolution, episodic detail</a>. On the other hand, patients with a rare form of dementia, known as <a href="http://memory.ucsf.edu/ftd/overview/ftd/forms/multiple/sd">semantic dementia</a>, can remember episodic information, but not the facts that glue it all together. Intriguingly, these individuals show early degeneration of another part of the brain called the anterior temporal lobe (thought to be critical for semantic memory).</p>

<h2>Networks versus areas</h2>

<p>But can we see a similar distinction in the healthy brain? As reflecting on our past is highly complex, it seems likely that different brain regions must work together to achieve it. And studies using <a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-fmri/">functional MRI</a> have shown that personal memories activate <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.22008/abstract">large networks in the brain</a>. </p>

<p>So it appears that memory cannot be boiled down to one or two particular brain areas. We have to think more widely than that. The brain itself is made up of both grey and white tissue. The white part, known as “white matter”, contains fibres that allow information to travel between different areas of the brain. So could these connections themselves predict <em>how</em> we remember? </p>

<p>In our latest study, published in the journal <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001094521730165X">Cortex</a>, we explored this question by using a brain scanning technique known as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18635164">diffusion MRI</a>. This method uses the movement of water molecules to map out the brain’s white matter pathways.</p>

<p>We asked 27 college-aged volunteers to lie still in the scanner as we collected images of their brains. Using these images we could identify specific pathways and pull out measures their structure – indicating how efficiently information can travel between connected regions. </p>

          </figure>

<p>Outside the scanner, each volunteer was asked to describe memories from their past in response to cue words, such as “party” or “holiday”. By going through and painstakingly coding each memory, we could work out how “episodic” and “semantic” each person’s memory was. For instance, precise spatial statements would count toward the episodic score (“The Eiffel Tower was directly behind us”), and facts would count toward the semantic score (“Paris is my sister’s favourite city”).</p>

<p>We found that the amount of rich, episodic detail that volunteers remembered was related to the connectivity of an arch-shaped white matter pathway called the fornix, which links to the hippocampus. So, the more efficiently the fornix can relay information from the hippocampus to surrounding regions, the more episodic someone’s memory is.</p>

<p>A different white matter pathway – catchily named the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8749.2011.04122.x/full">inferior longitudinal fasciculus </a> – strongly predicted how semantic people’s memories were. Interestingly, this long bundle of white matter is the major route from visual parts of the brain to the anterior temporal lobe  – the same region that is affected in cases of semantic dementia.</p>

<h2>Wired for memory</h2>

<p>These findings suggest that differences in how we each remember our past are reflected in how our brains are wired. Historically, neuroscience has <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-brain-a-radical-rethink-is-needed-to-understand-it-74460">tended to see brain regions as singletons</a>, working alone. These results suggest the alternative: that links between regions – and the networks they form – are critical for how we think and behave. </p>

<p>Our finding also supports the idea that there are separate memory “systems” in the brain. One for reliving time and place and another for pulling in general knowledge and personal facts.</p>

<p>Could these findings help people with memory problems? Not yet, but working out how memory works in healthy people may eventually help us understand exactly what goes wrong in the brain when we get diseases like Alzheimer’s – and help us treat it. For instance, people with damage to the “episodic” network, such as those with early Alzheimer’s disease, may benefit from semantic memory strategies to compensate. A recent study found that cuing memories with <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393217302476">physical objects</a> led to better episodic memory in people with Alzheimer’s.</p>

<p>There’s plenty we still don’t know about the brain’s white matter. A number of properties can affect how information travels along it, such as the density of fibres. In the future, we can use <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-40488545">new and powerful scanning techniques</a> to uncover the parts of white matter that drive these fascinating effects.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80506/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>Part of bitcoin’s appeal for many of its users is the <a href="https://theconversation.com/governments-will-struggle-to-put-bitcoin-under-lock-and-key-20731">lack of centralised control or regulation</a> by any government or bank. Instead it relies on a technology known as blockchain to underpin and secure transactions. But research my colleagues and I have conducted suggests that the lack of any social trust in the way blockchain operates poses a challenge for bitcoin’s further spread.</p>

<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/demystifying-the-blockchain-a-basic-user-guide-60226">Blockchain is</a> a public database that records digital transactions. These are validated by computers working within a worldwide network that solve complex coded problems. Whereas traditional bank transactions are authorised by financial institutions and controlled by governments through taxation and contracts between parties with known identities, blockchain is decentralised, unregulated and anonymous.</p>

<p>In our <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2838821">studies of blockchain’s users</a> we found that these features <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2892500">appeal to bitcoin users</a> because of increasing distrust of financial institutions and governments. The technology empowers people to regain control over their money, with <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025886">no restrictions</a> over where and when they can send it.</p>

<p>But our findings also indicate that two core aspects of blockchain’s design – the fact that transactions are anonymous and irreversible – pose <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025886">significant challenges</a> to the social trust among its users. Anonymity has an obvious appeal for people looking to avoid government control. And irreversible transactions were built into blockchain’s original design as a positive feature to address banks’ privilege of reversing transactions, even when the contract states that they were final. </p>

<p>But in practice, these features are a problem for many people. Most people are used to relying on the reputation of a seller to decide whether or not to buy from them – and the ability of the financial and legal system to help them if something goes wrong. But neither of these things are possible through blockchain.</p>

<h2>Paper trails have their advantages</h2>

<p>Most transactions don’t just involve moving bitcoin from one electronic wallet to another. In practice, they are often  part of a larger, two-way transactions where both parties send and receive assets such as bitcoins, real world currency or physical goods.</p>

<p>The issue is that the blockchain only records the movement of bitcoin, not the movement of other currencies or goods. Because there is no authority to complain to, this raises a major risk that users could fall prey to dishonest traders who fail to deliver their side of the deal.</p>

<figure class="align-center ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/177300/width754/file-20170707-3010-16nvv5z.jpg">

          </figure>

<p>In our latest study, we interviewed 20 bitcoin users recruited from five online groups from Malaysia, most of them with more than two years experience of using bitcoins. <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025886">Our research</a> indicates that more than 50% of participants would prefer blockchain’s transactions to be regulated and identifiable, so that transactions can be either reversed or the dishonest trader legally sanctioned.</p>

<p>This shows there is a tension between the freedom and empowerment of blockchain’s unregulated nature, and the lack of security that most people are accustomed to receiving from traditional financial institutions. If this is not addressed, such tension may limit the spread of bitcoin beyond its current base. It could even reduce the number of bitcoin users involved in such two-way transactions, as more people become aware of the risks of dishonest traders. In contrast, the use of blockchain for one-way transactions such as remittance payments will continue to grow, as they are less affected by dishonest traders.</p>

<h2>What can be done?</h2>

<p>Even bitcoin’s current users still operate largely under the traditional mindset of centralised and regulated currencies. Bitcoin advocates may need to find ways to encourage users to develop a new mental approach to unregulated blockchain technology.</p>

<p>But developers could also build tools to address some of bitcoin users’ concerns. For example, there may be a way to record whether the real-world elements of bitcoin transactions are also verified, authorised and stored on the public ledger. Electronic wallets could be linked to a reputation file that users could view before agreeing to a deal, much like sites such as eBay allow consumers to rate sellers. And new mechanisms built on top of the irreversible blockchain protocol could enable individual two-way transactions to be reversed. </p>

<p>Without doing something to tackle these challenges, the very thing that caught people’s attention about bitcoin in the first place could end up stifling its growth and eventually consigning it to history.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80486/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

Conventional scientific wisdom says no. As physicist Lawrence Krauss puts it in <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/The-Greatest-Story-Ever-Told-So-Far/Lawrence-Krauss/9781471158377">his latest book</a>, our evolution on this planet is just a “cosmic accident”. If you believe otherwise, many would accuse you of suffering from some kind of religious delusion.</p>

<p>I don’t think this view of life is necessarily correct. Despite this, my worldview is entirely naturalistic – it doesn’t rely on invoking any supernatural powers. And I usually do agree with conventional scientific wisdom. However, I know of one possible mechanism by which life could, in fact, be endowed with a natural purpose. The idea, just <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2017/4745379/">published in the journal Complexity</a>, is highly speculative but worth considering.</p>

<p>In biological natural selection, genes’ ability to replicate themselves depends on how well they can encode traits that permit organisms to out-reproduce other members of their own species. Such traits – for example camouflage to avoid predators or eyes to enable vision – are adaptations to the environment, as opposed to traits that are just byproducts of adaptations or random genetic noise. Clearly, the purpose of these adaptations is to solve difficult problems (like seeing, digesting or thinking).</p>

<p>Because organisms are bundles of complex adaptations, they are the most improbably complex things in the universe. And improbable complexity is, in fact, the hallmark of natural selection – the fundamental way in which we recognise that a trait actually is an adaptation. This makes them improbably low in “entropy”, which is the degree of disorder in a physical system. A basic law of physics is that entropy tends to always be increasing so that systems become more disordered (known as the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics</a>”). It’s because of this law that you can crack an egg and mix it all together to make an omelette (making it more disordered), but you can’t turn the omelette neatly back into an egg with shell, white and yolk (making it more ordered).</p>

<figure class="align-center ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/176944/width754/file-20170705-9733-1uxa774.jpg">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Because natural selection is the process that “designs” organisms – incrementally organising random, disordered matter into complex, functional organs – it is the most powerful anti-entropic process that we know of. Without the incremental changes that natural selection allows, the only way a complex adaptation like a mammalian eye could come into existence would be as the result of random chance. And the likelihood of that is extremely low. </p>

<p>Biological natural selection explains how adaptations have purpose (to facilitate survival and reproduction), and why organisms behave purposefully. It does not explain, however, how life in general could have any transcendent purpose. To figure out the point of our existence we require a higher-order explanation, like the one I describe.</p>

<h2>Cosmological evolution</h2>

<p>My higher-order explanation is based on cosmologist <a href="https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/people/lee-smolin">Lee Smolin’s</a> theory of cosmological natural selection. Smolin founded his theory on the increasingly popular view that our universe exists in an innumerably vast population of replicating universes – <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-theory-of-parallel-universes-is-not-just-maths-it-is-science-that-can-be-tested-46497">a multiverse</a>. Many physicists put stock in the idea of there being a multiverse, because its existence is predicted by <a href="http://fqxi.org/community/articles/display/145">eternal inflation</a>, our most promising model of universe origins.</p>

<p>Smolin reasoned that in a multiverse, universes that were better at reproducing would become more common. He proposed that they could be created from existing black holes. And if black holes are how universes reproduce, then cosmological natural selection would favour universes that contained more black holes. In this theory, life is simply the accidental byproduct of processes “designed” by selection to produce black holes.</p>

<p>Smolin’s theory has considerable intuitive appeal. It seems analogous to Darwin’s selection theory. And black holes do seem to be likely candidates to give birth to new universes. A black hole is an infinitely small concentration of spacetime, matter and energy – a singularity. And it’s exactly this type of phenomenon we believe the Big Bang started from.</p>

<p>In one glaring aspect, however, Smolin’s theory falls short of being analogous to Darwin’s. It does not predict that the most improbably complex feature of our universe will be the one most likely to be an adaptation produced by cosmological natural selection. Because that least entropic feature is life rather than black holes.</p>

<figure class="align-center ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/176958/width754/file-20170705-29992-rlpk8l.jpg">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Smolin <em>does</em> identify life as the least entropic known thing. His theory, however, does not make the connection between entropy and selection. That is, it doesn’t acknowledge that just as improbably low entropy is the hallmark of selection operating at the biological level, this is likely to be true at the cosmological level as well.</p>

<h2>The future of life</h2>

<p>If life is, in fact, the universe’s reproductive system, the implication is that sufficiently evolved intelligence could acquire the ability to create new cosmic environments. In order to be habitable, these baby universes would need to replicate the physical laws of the lifeform’s native universe. Cosmologists expect that in billions of years, our universe will cease being habitable. By that point, however, life could conceivably have become intelligent enough to produce new life-supporting universes, perhaps by civilisations “building” something similar to black holes.</p>

<p>However, scientists currently lack the methods to test the idea conclusively. A start would be to discover that there are indeed other universes – something that <a href="https://theconversation.com/could-cold-spot-in-the-sky-be-a-bruise-from-a-collision-with-a-parallel-universe-78563">astronomers are currently looking for</a>.</p>

<p>A basic prediction it does make, however, is that human technological progress is likely to continue into the vastly distant future. If cosmological selection “designed” life to use its technology for universe reproduction, then it seems reasonable to expect that life will succeed in this regard – just as you’d expect an eye produced by biological selection to actually succeed in seeing. </p>

<p>That doesn’t mean that unceasing technological progress is guaranteed – after all, we could use our technology to destroy ourselves. Nevertheless we can reasonably expect humanity – or whatever it evolves into – to be sticking around for a long, long time.</p>

<p>It’s not a new idea to propose in general terms that life might constitute a mechanism for cosmological evolution – good histories of this idea are <a href="http://evodevouniverse.com/wiki/Cosmological_natural_selection_(fecund_universes)">here</a> and <a href="https://evolution-institute.org/article/could-cosmological-natural-selection-assign-a-function-to-life/?source=tvol">here</a>. The new aspect of my research is that it spells out exactly why life – as the least entropic known thing in the universe – is more likely than black holes (or anything else) to be a mechanism of universe reproduction. I hope others will continue to explore this idea.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/79689/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

But these animals have been locked in their own co-evolutionary arms race for millions of years – a fight against parasites, specifically nematode worms. Now <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-04695-5">my latest research</a> has shown that snails evolved to use their shells in this battle as a way to encapsulate and kill the parasites as part of their immune system.</p>

<p>Terrestrial gastropods (slugs and snails) are one of the most diverse and abundant groups of animals on Earth, with between 65,000 and 80,000 species existing for <a href="http://www.cabi.org/cabebooks/ebook/20013129610">400m years</a>. The success of snails is partly due to the evolution of the shell, a hard exoskeleton made of <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JbAgy0AAopsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">crystalline calcium carbonate</a>. The shell has previously just been seen as a way to protect snails from extreme temperatures and from predators. Now we know it also offers defence against nematodes.</p>

<p>These parasites are also incredibly numerous. We think there are around 100m nematode species but <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279896164_Recent_developments_in_marine_benthic_biodiversity_research">only 25,000</a> have been identified.
Many are parasites of animals, plants and arthropod invertebrates, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19265989">108 species</a> are associated with snails and slugs.</p>

<p>One species (<em>Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita</em>) is so lethal to some slugs and snails it has been formulated into a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17912686">biological control agent</a> (Nemaslug) for farmers and gardeners to use instead of chemical pellets. These nematodes are applied to soil and hunt out the slugs and snails, penetrating and killing them between <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09583159309355306">four and 21 days</a> later.</p>

<p>We knew that snails are generally quite resistant to <em>P. hermaphrodita</em> but slugs are <a href="http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15685411-00003053">highly susceptible</a>. To investigate this further, I exposed some common snails (<em>Cepaea nemoralis</em>) to <em>P. hermaphrodita</em> for several weeks. When I dissected the snails at the end of the experiment, I found that the nematodes were trapped, fixed and killed in the shell.</p>

<figure class="align-center ">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Over time, cells from the shell start adhering to the nematode cuticle, cover the entire body and then fix it to the inner layer of the shell. Often hundreds of nematodes are encapsulated at a time. This is not a specific response of snails to just <em>P. hermaphrodita</em> as other nematodes were shown to be encapsulated that do not kill snails.</p>

<h2>More evidence</h2>

<p>This encapsulation ability doesn’t just happen in the lab. Samples of wild <em>C. nemoralis</em> snails caught in Caithness in northern Scotland and Merseyside in north west England also had nematodes fixed in their shells. In some cases, 60% of the snails captured had nematodes trapped in their shells, with one containing as many as 101 parasites.</p>

<figure class="align-center ">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Other snail species appear to have this ability too. By studying 1,321 shells from 43 genera (groups of species) from the Liverpool and Manchester museums, I found that nematode encapsulation is incredibly common. The evidence even suggests that this ability would have been present in the ancestor of most of today’s slugs and snails, which lived between <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1088622/">90m and 120m years ago</a>. </p>

<p>By viewing these musuem collections, I also found that nematode encapsulation creates a permanent record of the parasites in the shell. <em>C. nemoralis</em> shells from 1909 and 1864 still had nematodes present, and even sub-fossil shells that were more than 500-years-old had nematodes encased. This raises the tantalising prospect of harvesting these shells for preserved nematode DNA and studying nematode evolution through time.</p>

<figure class="align-center ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/176908/width754/file-20170705-9733-j9cma0.png">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Finally, I found that the reduced, internalised shell that slugs have under their skin can also encase and kill invading nematodes. So even though the slug shells play no role in protecting them from predators or environmental conditions, they have retained this important ability to trap, encase and kill nematodes.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this research shows that exoskeletons, thought of as hard, rigid structures used as barriers, can evolve new roles. It is the first example of how an exoskeleton can be co-opted as an immune defense mechanism providing another level of protection against parasites.</p>

<p>It also raises the interesting question of whether the shell originally evolved to kill nematodes. The earliest ancestor of molluscs (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7099/pdf/nature04894.pdf"><em>Odontogriphus</em></a>), lived 550m years ago and also had a shell. It was small and could not provide protection against environmental extremes – and there were no predators at that time. But there were nematodes at least <a href="http://www.biol.uw.edu.pl/ewolucja/ludzie/Nematoda.pdf">470m years ago</a>. If these posed a threat to <em>Odontogriphus</em>, it may have influenced the evolution of the shell.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80564/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>One year on from the game’s release, its developer, Niantic, is now trying to renew some users’ excitement with new features, new monsters to catch and live events to encourage more people to get out and log on. But even if this fails to significantly revive the game’s wider popularity, Pokémon Go actually retains a surprisingly large loyal fan base that could sustain the game for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/01/report-pokemon-go-has-now-crossed-1-billion-in-revenue/">reaching US$1 billion in revenue</a> faster than any other mobile game, the <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-niantic-didnt-need-marketing-to-make-pokemon-go-viral-63159">initial hype</a> around Pokémon Go rapidly gave way to a significant decline in mainstream popularity for several reasons. First, <a href="heavy.com/games/2016/08/cant-log-in-to-pokemon-go-how-to-fix-humbled-server-error-pokemongo-login-stuck-broken/">software issues and network availability</a> problems deterred casual players. Getting booted out of the game, or failing to log in at all, turned it from a fun distraction to an irritating chore.</p>

<p>Second, as players began to catch more of the 150 original Pokémon but struggled to <a href="uk.businessinsider.com/pokemon-go-what-happens-when-you-hit-level-20-2016-7?r=US&amp;IR=T">find the elusive final creatures</a>, the incentive to play decreased. The routine of catching, evolving and battling the same monsters became just that, routine.</p>

<p>Third, the game became a race for status instead of being about exploring your neighbourhood. Many players used <a href="https://pgbot.org/">automated accounts</a> to reach the highest levels of the game, making the point of putting in hours of game time to beat your friends redundant.</p>

<p>This last point highlights Niantic’s biggest problem in continuing to develop Pokémon Go: establishing exactly what its players ultimately hope to achieve. And <a href="www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/801707/Pokemon-Go-news-update-grass-event-end-time-Niantic-Shiny-grass-type">critics claim</a> Niantic has done little to develop the game in any meaningful way.</p>

<h2>Returning players</h2>

<p>But the company has been able to bolster usage and entice some old players back through game updates, social media and live events. A second generation of Pokémon to catch was released in February 2017, leading to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/02/28/gen-2-caused-a-huge-spike-in-pokemon-go-play-but-its-fading-fast/#3450adfb193d">a brief spike in players</a> and helping the game reach <a href="tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/pokemon-go-crosses-750-million-downloads-381827.html">750m downloads</a>.</p>

<p>Fulfilling its original promise to get people exploring and mixing with others, Niantic has sponsored and organised <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/05/04/pokemon-go-is-about-to-start-throwing-officially-sponsored-block-parties/#657226a64150">special events</a> that have seen <a href="www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/03/03/national/pokemon-go-deploys-snorlax-quake-hit-kyushu/#.WUeq0ev1Dcs">thousands take to the streets</a> to catch rare Pokémon.</p>

<p>Now, to celebrate the game’s first birthday, <a href="www.trustedreviews.com/news/pokemon-go-news-when-is-next-update-best-new-features-trading">Niantic plans</a> to enable users to catch the missing “legendary” Pokémon and introduce new ways for friends to work together in battles. The developers are clearly trying to reassert the game’s founding ideology: get out, explore and interact with people and places.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/tech/games-apps/review-pokemon-gos-new-gym-system-and-raid-battles-inject-new-life-into-game-but">Initial reviews</a> of the new battle system suggest changes have somewhat levelled the playing field because players receive more rewards for battling and working in teams. While gameplay has not fundamentally changed – for example, you can’t battle your friends outside of the structured gym system – the greater emphasis on teaming up to defeat opponents I think will entice returning players.</p>

<h2>Enduring fandom</h2>

<p>Yet perhaps more important than the new features is the surprising extent to which fans have already made the game part of their lives. A devoted community of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/04/05/believe-it-or-not-pokemon-go-has-65-million-monthly-active-players/#35320c81121d">around 65m</a> monthly users has played Pokémon Go from the outset and eagerly anticipate the proposed updates. Initial fervour may have dissipated, yet arguably neither the cultural significance nor the core popularity (once the hype was over) of the game has waned. </p>

<p>Fans continue to congregate online to discuss the game on tribute sites such as <a href="https://thesilphroad.com/">The Silph Road</a>. The online forum Reddit continues to act as a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/5kqn06/catching_farfetchd_japan_or_hk/">tourist guide</a> for fans on holiday who want to catch elusive Pokémon. And loyal fans go to extreme lengths to progress in the game. One man <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/07/pokemon-go-player-sponsored-by-marriott.html">circumnavigated the globe</a> to catch those unavailable in his home country.</p>

          </figure>

<p>Such instances of global exploration show how the game continues to inspire fans. They constitute an international community that uses Pokémon Go as a means to interact with their environment, socialise online, and travel. Fandom is about participation, being part of something that extends beyond the individual. Pokémon Go fans represent a lively and evolving participatory culture.</p>

<p>With the legendary Pokémon imminent, new generations of monsters still pending and increasingly interactive elements of gameplay, Niantic is slowly turning 2016’s hype into a lasting fan experience. The game may not get the media coverage it did but that matters little to fans whose routine still includes a walk around their neighbourhood to increase their stats, talking online with others, or whose holiday destination is influenced by the whereabouts of exclusive Pokémon. Just as the Pokémon franchise has lasted for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/2016/2/26/11120098/pokemon-games-list-history-timeline-release-dates">over 20 years</a>, Pokémon Go endures as a communal and interactive platform.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80438/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

British hopes and dreams weigh once again on one shy Scotsman’s shoulders. Expectant tennis fans will throng together on Murray Mound to eat strawberries and cream and talk up their hero’s chances. Can he do it again? Is he mentally prepared for the challenge? </p>

<p>New <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347217301975">research</a> into the noises that Andy Murray and so many of his fellow players make during matches could take out some of the guesswork about how they feel they are performing.</p>

<p>Grunting is now an established – if controversial – part of Wimbledon. So much so that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/11730027/Prime-Minister-weighs-into-Wimbledon-grunting-row.html">David Cameron</a>, when the UK prime minister, joked that spectators should bring earplugs. In fact, since its popular emergence three decades ago, grunting has consistently divided opinion in the tennis world.</p>

<p>An early prominent vocal culprit was Monica Seles, who consistently drew fire for her shrieks. Since then, the phenomenon has become commonplace on both the men’s and women’s tours, but not without resistance. The volume of Maria Sharapova’s and Michelle Larcher de Brito’s grunts has been compared to that of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/26/wimbledon-battle-grunters-maria-sharapova">a chainsaw or a lion’s roar</a> and, in the aftermath of one particular outbreak of grunting controversy, Martina Navratilova labelled it “cheating pure and simple”.</p>

<p>Her <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/martina-navratilova-the-grunting-has-to-stop-3s6b8j09g5r">gripe</a> was that grunts drown out the sound of the ball hitting the racquet, which hinders players in assessing the speed, spin, and cleanness of the incoming shot. She has a point too – research shows that silencing Sharapova’s grunt improves the perception of the <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/30.PMS.120v20x2">speed of her serve</a> and that white noise might impair an opponent’s perception of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20957210">shot direction</a>.</p>



<h2>Roaring success</h2>

<p>Others in and around the game defend the guttural groans. Many players are <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/33436549">unperturbed</a> by the noises, while others question why complaints focus almost exclusively on female players in a sport full of fairly vocal young bucks. Sport psychologists argue that grunts <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2014/09/04/grunting-leads-to-better-tennis-says-science/">improve psychological focus</a>, motivating players to exert maximum effort and allowing them to perform in a more relaxed, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10919656/Wimbledon-2014-Why-do-women-players-grunt.html">subconscious state</a>. </p>

<p>It’s worth remembering that after the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-03/sports/sp-1393_1_monica-seles">criticism</a> Seles received in her quarter and semi-finals at Wimbledon 1992, she lost heavily in the final, having made a vow of silence she later strongly regretted.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/5499586&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<p>In her silence, Seles may have suffered not only psychologically, but physically too. A number of recent studies demonstrate that grunting allows players to hit the ball <a href="http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2016/02000/The_Effects_of_Forced_Exhalation_and_Inhalation,.18.aspx">significantly harder</a>, without increasing their heart rate or <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=Grunting+in+tennis+increases+ball+velocity+but+not+oxygen+cost&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_sdtp=">oxygen consumption</a>. In a sport where a point here and there can be the difference between winning and losing, this extra oomph is vital.</p>

<h2>Winning and losing</h2>

<p>Now, our latest research shows that grunting may confer advantages not only to the vocaliser, but to the opponent too. Analysing 50 matches featuring some of the world’s top 30 tennis players, we found that players produced grunts that were higher in pitch during matches they lost than during those they won.</p>

<p>Moreover, while the pitch of players’ grunts increased as matches progressed, the difference in pitch between losses and wins was apparent from the early stages of matches, and didn’t change in size as matches wore on. Therefore, it seems that the shift in pitch when winning versus losing is not due to players feeling the progressive effects of scoreboard pressure, or revelling in racking up set after set. </p>

<p>Instead, this difference may reflect longer-term physiological or psychological factors that may manifest even before matches begin. For example, the results of previous encounters, form, world ranking, fatigue and injuries could all influence stress and perceived dominance ahead of matches, which are both known to affect the pitch of our voices.</p>



<p>Most importantly, we found that when competitive tennis players were played short clips of professional players’ grunts (with no access to visual cues), they could identify which of two grunt sequences produced by the same player came from a match that the player lost. Our research therefore suggests that tennis grunts may provide opponents with a valuable window into the other player’s mindset during a match.</p>

<p>Listeners’ accuracy was only 10% above chance levels, likely because players’ grunt pitch varies substantially across and within matches, so this is by no means a fool proof way to systematically predict the outcome of a match. But, with prior knowledge of a player’s “usual” grunt pitch, it’s certainly something that viewers, opposing players and even broadcasters might consider paying more attention to. Players who have faced each other multiple times may already consciously or subconsciously pick up on these cues. If so, such information is likely to influence their confidence, as is the case with basketball players responding to <a href="http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/abs/10.1123/jsep.2013-0199">visual changes</a> in nonverbal behaviour.</p>

<h2>Dog, deer or Djokovic?</h2>

<p>From a broader perspective, this research firmly places human nonverbal vocalisations in continuity with the calls of other mammals. Numerous studies have shown that nonhuman mammals use information contained within vocalisations as key influences on behaviour and decision-making in numerous contexts. For example, male <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/272/1566/941.short">red deer</a> use the roars of competing males to assess their size, and therefore who is likely to emerge from conflict victorious.</p>



<p>Humans are no exception. Like red deer, when we produce vocalisations in a competitive setting, we broadcast information about our internal state, which listeners can use to inform how likely we are to win. Because anatomy and physiology affect the vocal apparatus – the larynx and vocal tract – of all mammals in the same way, vocalisations broadcast information about vocalisers’ physical attributes and internal state, whether dog, deer, or Novak Djokovic.</p>

<p>Should we then be paying more heed to other primitive sounds like these? While our conscious attention is focused on the words that we speak, nonverbal vocalisations pepper our daily interactions; from grunts, laughs and sighs, to moans, roars and cries. Many of these noises are <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661316000206">highly similar</a> to calls produced by other mammals, and likely communicate a wealth of information that has surprisingly been barely investigated by scientists so far.</p>

<p>Perhaps we know so little about human vocalisations because we feel embarrassed to acknowledge our animal self. In my view, they’re certainly nothing to be ashamed of – so the next time you hear a tennis grunt, embrace it as part of our nature. But remember, that noise might be revealing more than you think.

Now I have discovered that Google has met with Genomic England – a company set up by the Department of Health to deliver <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-the-100-000-genomes-project-will-focus-on-rare-diseases-36155">the 100,000 Genomes Project</a> – to discuss whether DeepMind could get involved. </p>

<p>If this were to happen, it could help bring down costs and speed up genetic sequencing – potentially helping the science to flourish. But what are the risks of letting a private company have access to sensitive genetic data? </p>

<p>Genomic sequencing has huge potential – it could hold the key to improving our understanding of a range of diseases, including cancer, and eventually help find treatments for them. The 100,000 Genomes Project was set up by the government to sequence genomes of 100,000 people. And it won’t stop there. A new report from the UK’s chief medical officer, Sally Davies, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-40479533">is calling for an expansion</a> of the project.</p>

<p>However, a statement by the Department of Health in response to a freedom of information (FoI) request I made in February reveals this decision has already been made. The department said in this response that the project will be integrated into a single national genomic database. The purpose of this will be to support “care and research, and the acceleration of industrial usage”. Though it will “inevitably exceed the original 100,000 genomes, we do not anticipate that there will be a set target for how many genomes it should contain”, the statement reads.  </p>

<p>The costs of sequencing the genome on a national scale are prohibitive. The first human genome was sequenced at a cost of US$3 billion. However, almost two decades later, Illumina, which is responsible for the sequencing side of the 100,000 Genomes Project, <a href="www.nature.com/news/is-the-1-000-genome-for-real-1.14530">produced the first “$1,000 genome”</a> – a staggering reduction in cost. Applying machine learning to genomics – that is, general artificial intelligence – has the potential to significantly reduce the costs further. By building a neural network, these algorithms can interpret huge amounts of genetic, health, and environmental data to predict a persons health status, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/ai-predicts-heart-attacks-better-doctors-n752011">such as their level of risk of heart attack</a>.  </p>

<p>DeepMind is already working with the NHS. As part of a partnership with several NHS trusts, the company has built <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2086454-revealed-google-ai-has-access-to-huge-haul-of-nhs-patient-data/">various platforms</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-health/streams/">an app</a> and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/05/google-deepmind-nhs-machine-learning-blindness">machine learning system</a> to monitor patients in various ways, alerting clinical teams when they are at risk. </p>

<p>But it’s been controversial. The company announced the first of these collaborations in February 2016, saying it was building an app to help hospital staff monitor patients with kidney disease. However, it later emerged that the agreement went far beyond this, giving DeepMind Health access to vast amounts of patient data – including, in one instance, 1.6m patient records. The Information Commissioner’s Office ruled recently that the way patient data was shared by the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40483202">violated UK privacy law</a>. The company asserts that patient data “will never be linked to Google products or services or commercialised”.  </p>

<p>Google’s ambitions to digitise healthcare continue. I received a response to an FoI request in May which reveals that Google and Genomics England have met to discuss “using Google’s DeepMind among other subjects” to analyse genomic data. </p>

<p>Davies insists that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-40479533">data could be anonymised</a>. The Department of Health always promise that medical data used in such initiatives will be anonymised, yet one of the reasons that Care.data (an initiative to store all patient data on a single database) <a href="https://theconversation.com/care-data-has-been-scrapped-but-your-health-data-could-still-be-shared-62181">was abandoned</a> is that this was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/19/nhs-patient-data-available-companies-buy">shown to be untrue</a>. I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/mar/10/privacy-and-the-100000-genome-project">have also shown</a> that the department has misinformed the public about the level of access granted to commercial actors in the 100,000 Genome Project. In particular it said the data would be “pseudonymised” rather than anonymised, meaning there would still be information available such as  age or geographical location.</p>

<h2>The danger of personalisation</h2>

<p>But more generally, what could genomic information add to Google’s already far-reaching database of individual information? A hint lies in its self-confessed aspiration to organise our lives for us. The algorithms “will get better, and we will get better at personalisation”, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c3e49548-088e-11dc-b11e-000b5df10621">according to Eric Schmidt</a>, executive chairman of Google’s parent company Alphabet. This will “enable Google users to ask the question, ‘what shall I do tomorrow?’, or ‘what job shall I take?’”.</p>

<p>With personalisation as its ultimate “goal”, Google intends to use the machine learning algorithms which track our digital footprint and target users with personalised advertising based on their preferences. It also wants to analyse health and genomic data to make predictions such as when a person <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429921-400-global-agency-needed-for-battling-infectious-diseases/">might develop bipolar disorder</a> or tell us what we should do with our lives. </p>

<p>Let us not forget that data, genomic or otherwise, is the <a href="www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721656-data-economy-demands-new-approach-antitrust-rules-worlds-most-valuable-resource">oil of the digital era</a>. What is stopping genomic information from being <a href="www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-siciliano/data-brokers-what-are-the_b_5185127.html">captured, bought and sold</a>? We cannot assume that people will make life choices based upon their “genetic profile” without undue pressure – commercial or governmental. </p>

<p>As for how genomic data might be used and what decisions will be taken about us, the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3115985-APPLICANTS-REPLY-to-GOVT-OBSERVATIONS-PDF.html">mass surveillance</a> by government agencies of their own citizens is a chilling reminder of the way information technology can be used. There is something unpalatable about everything being connected and everything being known.</p>

<p>When it comes to genetics, the implications are particularly frightening. For example, there are claims of evidence of a <a href="www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29760212">link between genes and criminality</a>. We know that <a href="https://theconversation.com/sex-offending-may-be-in-the-genes-but-knowing-that-wont-prevent-it-40286">40% of sexual offending risk is down to genetic factors</a>. A “single national knowledge base” as the one the UK government is aiming to create might therefore be used for broad genetic profiling. Although early intervention programmes that buy into genetically deterministic notions of “crime genes” are reductive, serious debate about policies involving genetic information will no doubt happen soon. </p>

<p>We can already see the beginnings of this in the United States. The bill <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1313">Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act</a> – which has received strong backing from <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/13/genetic-privacy-wellness/">Republicans and business groups</a> – would allow companies to require employees to undergo genetic testing. The results would be seen by employers, and should employees refuse to participate they would face significantly higher insurance costs. </p>

<p>Too much personalisation is likely to be intrusive. The challenge, then, will be to harness the potential of genomics while introducing measures to keep government and big business in check. The UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee’s <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/inquiry2/">inquiry on genomics and genome editing</a> was cut short (due to the recent snap general election). Its recommendations for further lines of enquiry include creating a quasi-independent body, which could be more attuned to broader, social and ethical concerns. This might introduce more balance at a pivotal time for the future of human genetic technologies.</p>

From <a href="https://theconversation.com/folding-graphene-like-origami-may-allow-us-to-wear-sensors-in-our-skin-45346?sr=2">two-dimensional new materials</a> <a href="https://theconversation.com/from-living-computers-to-nano-robots-how-were-taking-dna-beyond-genetics-60580?sr=1">to nano-robots</a>, many of the latest advances are being made at scales impossible to see with the human eye. </p>

<p>The latest technique to shake things up at the micro level is a way to trap and study individual living cells to try to understand why they malfunction when diseased. Until now, scientists have done this with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22767244">electrode “microtraps”</a> and <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/288/5463/113.full.pdf?ck=nck">highly complex networks of channels</a> carved into plastic chips.</p>

<p>But now there’s a way to analyse up to millions of cells simultaneously by putting them inside tiny water-in-oil droplets <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16511628">not much bigger than the cells themselves</a>. This could massively speed up efforts to identify diseased cells, find new drug molecules or new ways to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18651063">diagnose disease</a>.</p>

<p>The days when scientists carried out experiments by mixing chemicals in large glass flasks are long gone. Nowadays, tests are performed in trays punctuated by a number of “microwell” holes that mean just a few microlitres (millionths of a litre) of each sample is needed. The difficulty with going much smaller is that it’s hard to move liquid around at this scale because really tiny <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20559601">drops tend to clump together or evaporate</a>.</p>

<p>Although the potential of encapsulating single cells was identified as <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v181/n4620/abs/1811419a0.html">early as the 1950s</a>, the droplet field has really picked up pace with the emergence of fabrication technologies borrowed from the semiconductor industry.</p>

          </figure>

<p>The microdroplet solution is to separate and protect each picolitre (one trillionth of a litre) drop of water by wrapping it in oil. To do this, you feed the water and oil through tiny tubes in a “microfluidic” device and force them to meet at a cross junction where they combine into individual microdroplets. This can create <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23805985">many thousands of identical tiny chemical reactors a second</a>.</p>

<p>Other microfluidic devices can be used to combine, split or sort the droplets, just as a scientist might do at a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28390246">larger scale with a pipette</a> Specially formulated chemicals at the interface between the water and oil keep the droplets <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10392">stable for days at a time</a>.</p>

<h2>Finding a cellular needle in a haystack</h2>

<p>Droplets are an attractive proposition for tackling needle-in-a-haystack problems, such as isolating very rare cells with a unique mutation or molecular make-up. For example, cells from a tumour can sometimes break off and circulate through the bloodstream, potentially causing cancer elsewhere in the body (metastasis). Finding a way to detect these circulating tumour cells (CTCs) would essentially provide a blood test update on the state of a patient’s cancer. But they are very hard to find because they exist at concentrations as low as <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v14/n9/full/nrc3686.html">one per 10 ml of blood</a>. Using a microdroplet technique could allow doctors to quickly comb through the cells from a patient’s blood sample <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/articles/27311775/">to find a CTC</a>.</p>

<p>Microdroplet techniques can even help confine DNA molecules together with the proteins produced by specific genes, such as biocatalysts or enzymes that help enable certain chemical reactions in a living organism. This means we can find rare DNA mutations that result in more efficient biocatalysts, a process called <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/47/E7383.full.pdf">directed evolution</a>. This is helpful because many biocatalysts are responsible for reactions needed for industrial processes, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593117300418">from washing using detergent powders to making biofuels</a>.</p>

<p>Today, the process of screening gene libraries with millions of encoded members is becoming more and more routine. Another promising application is to use environmental samples in the search for molecules that could be used as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10008">antibiotics or anti-cancer agents</a>. Likewise, researchers can assess collections of antibodies with the hope of finding <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/29/11570.long">one that can function as a drug</a>.</p>

<p>Microdroplet techniques do have their limits. For example, small molecules can sometimes diffuse through the oil phase making droplets in effect leaky compartments. Yet there are still many potential advances to be made. For example, one can envision truly <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-science-is-using-the-genetics-of-disease-to-make-drugs-better-30747">personalised medicine</a> where many different drugs are rapidly tested against many different patient cells to find which one is best to prescribe. Microdroplets have had just a decade of use.

Humans tend to think that purring is a sign of happiness in a cat – and indeed it can be – but there are other reasons why our feline friends produce this particular vocalisation. </p>

<p>Purring is a habit that develops very early in a cat’s life, while suckling from its mother, so clearly it is not a sound that is directed solely at humans. Cat owners will be well aware that a cat can produce more than one kind of purr, just as they have a whole repertoire of meows, chirps, growls, spits and other sounds.</p>

          </figure>

<p>The purr that is produced during suckling, is quite different in quality to the purr that you will hear when your cat is sprawling across your lap being stroked. <a href="http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0960982209011683/1-s2.0-S0960982209011683-main.pdf?_tid=ca2feb88-5bde-11e7-a4e7-00000aab0f26&amp;acdnat=1498639989_de63d91cbfcdfca568260fc9abd07b74">Analysis of the sound</a> has shown when a cat is asking for food, whether from its mother or a human – the purr contains a high-pitched note that is similar in frequency to a cry (though not as loud). It may have something of the effect of the cry of a newborn, which affects the hormonal state of female mammals and <a href="http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0166432807000897/1-s2.0-S0166432807000897-main.pdf?_tid=e02955ac-5d08-11e7-b2f7-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1498768017_ddab9098f69493f99acf804e0fd07bc3">elicits a care-giving response</a>.</p>

<p>When a cat is being petted or is snuggled up to its owner on the sofa, the purr it produces is much more soporific and generally soothing, and acoustic analysis shows that <a href="http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0960982209011683/1-s2.0-S0960982209011683-main.pdf?_tid=ca2feb88-5bde-11e7-a4e7-00000aab0f26&amp;acdnat=1498639989_de63d91cbfcdfca568260fc9abd07b74">the “cry” component is missing</a>. </p>

<p>Adult cats will often purr when they are close to or in <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.jfms.2003.09.013">physical contact</a> with another cat, engaging in grooming for example. They will also do it when they play with an inanimate object, or while eating, which can be at a time when they are alone. However, the most usual time for purring is in company, and it can be the care soliciting sound, asking to be fed or stroked, or an indication of social pleasure. </p>

<h2>The darker side</h2>

<p>Strangely, vets also report that cats will purr when they are in <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=GgUwg6gU7n4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=purring+in+solitary+felines&amp;ots=V-aN4Ee6c9&amp;sig=UqH6gx1KDoto8wtzJjgn7tS3g8M#v=onepage&amp;q=purring%2520in%2520solitary%2520felines&amp;f=false">great pain</a> or just before death. This seems to be illogical if it is a sound relating to pleasure, but in fact, it could be that the cat is asking for help. </p>

<p>It could also be a way of masking the fact that the cat is injured and vulnerable. If you are a small animal, even a carnivore, it is not good to show weakness as this could encourage larger predators to come along and eat you. The purr may be the cat equivalent of “everything’s fine, I’m on top of the world. Nothing to see here, move along please”.</p>

<h2>Can big cats purr too?</h2>

<p>There has long been a debate about whether the “big cats” can purr – and the belief has been that cats that roar, such as lions and tigers, cannot purr. Although there is no conclusive evidence on this subject, it seems that even cats that roar <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2907.2002.00113.x/full">purr as cubs</a> while suckling. </p>

<p>All mammals have a bone or series of bones in the throat called the hyoid apparatus, which supports the larynx and tongue. In cat species that roar the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00088.x/full">hyoid apparatus is not entirely made of bone</a> but retains some parts as cartilage, while cat species that purr have a hyoid that is completely bony. This modification may permit roaring, but does not necessarily mean that purring is impossible. It is believed that cheetah, ocelot, margay, serval, and lynx, among other species, can purr, and it is suggested that <a href="http://www.zobodat.at/pdf/Zeitschrift-Saeugetierkunde_59_0087-0104.pdf">jaguar, leopard, lion and tiger</a> cannot – or if they can they’ve kept it secret all these years.</p>

<h2>Process behind the purr</h2>

<p>The actual process of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0034568772900643">producing the purring sound</a> is complicated, and is still not completely understood, but it involves the muscles of the larynx and the diaphragm being activated by bursts of nerve activity that originate in the brain and occur 20 to 30 times every second. This happens on both in and out breaths, which accounts for the continuous sound of the purr. </p>

<p>The fact that a cat can do all this and simultaneously eat, knead the cushions, rip the chair leg to pieces or weave complicated patterns through your legs without getting stepped on makes one wonder what they would have achieved with opposable thumbs.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80216/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

I’ve always seen art as the converse – as something unquantifiable and fundamentally opposite to science.</p>

<p>But a recent collaboration with Hannah Imlach, an artist-in-residence here at Heriot-Watt University, has caused a dramatic change in my opinion, making it clear to me that science and art are inherently interconnected and that science can learn much from the world of art.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.microscopy.co.za/what-is-microscopy">Microscopy</a> is one of the highest-impact innovations in the history of science. With origins in the 1600s and the earliest parts of the <a href="https://explorable.com/science-and-enlightenment">scientific age of enlightenment</a>, microscopy has evolved to underpin almost all aspects of modern science. The largest impact is arguably in the life sciences, where the ability to observe the complex, transient and dynamic world of the single cell has revolutionised healthcare, quality of life and fundamental understanding.</p>

<p>Today’s microscopes include Nobel Prize-winning <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/physics/microscopes/fluorescence/">fluorescence</a> and <a href="http://jcs.biologists.org/content/124/10/1607">super-resolution</a> techniques which together have pushed microscopy into a new era, allowing us to see more detail than ever before. We can study highly specific parts of the living cell in real time and create computer models of this activity. We have reached the stage of being able to offer a direct and measurable description of the cellular world.</p>

<p>Within the complex world of the cellular microscopist, the essence of the microscope is often lost, the amazing beauty and elegance of the technology overlooked. Sometimes it is important to step back and take stock of what the imaging delivers. As scientists we focus on the all-important push to quantify data, often forgetting to ask ourselves what it is, in fact, we see when we look through the eyepiece.</p>

<h2>Common ground</h2>

<p>The Institute of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Bio-engineering at Heriot-Watt University was awarded a <a href="https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/news/archive/awards-focus-archive/artist-residence-grants">Leverhulme Artist in Residence</a> grant that allowed Hannah Imlach, a visual artist working primarily in sculpture, to work and study within our institute for a year. By fully immersing herself in our research environment, Hannah could shadow researchers and seek inspiration for new works that reflected the modern research and applications of microscopy.</p>

<p>A scientist collaborating with an artist seems a challenging idea. Interdisciplinary science and communication are central to modern science – and deservedly so – but the boundary between art and science is somewhat unbridged. Where do you begin – and where is the common ground?</p>

<p>To start, both scientist and artist shared a passion for observing the visual beauty of cells that are seen down a microscope. As the art was to be functional and sculptural, there was shared excitement in building prototype optical systems. These included various projection systems and large microscopes, all designed to merge the microscopy instrumentation with an artistic vision of the data being studied.</p>

<p>However, true overlap between the scientific and artistic process came in an entirely unexpected way, when the artist showed her sketchbooks to the scientists.</p>

<p>These were lovingly referred to as “lab books” by the scientists, and visually documented every thought and process being explored as the concepts and ideas formulated themselves into understanding and eventually structure. This was a developmental and thought process with direct parallels to the scientific method – and it led to a profound realisation on my part.</p>

<h2>Head and heart</h2>

<p>Whereas scientists may document their results and meticulously record and detail the analysis and discussions, they rarely do the same for setting out their ideas. It’s “all up here in my head” and rough paper and temporary whiteboard sketches often suffice. In this project, the artistic idea was laid bare and what was clear that within it was the very essence of how a scientific idea is born and brought to fruition.</p>

<p>In the same way, both scientist and artist follow a shared methodology: the first hypothesis, the uses of the base knowledge, abandoned ideas, initial results, interpreting them and developing them – all before evolving into the final experiment and results.</p>

<p>The so-called artistic process, seemingly uncoordinated and disorganised, mirrors the scientific process, only in this case it was more elegantly drawn and documented. It became clear that science and art can be the same – and that ultimately they are based on thoughts, ideas and passion. It’s only how we end up formulating those ideas and presenting our conclusions that actually differs.</p>

<p>Hannah’s piece, Fluorescence Projector, allows the viewer to fully immerse themselves in the world of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. It projects real data through a water-filled ball lens, inspired by the early 1600s microscopes, and reformulates the image into a floor projection screen. By intentionally allowing optical aberration and vibration to impart themselves on the sculpture, the viewer can interact and seek depth within the projected data.</p>

<p>This has left me asking the question: how do we process scientific observations? How do we develop our ideas, and transfer these to experiment, to understanding and then disseminate? These are simple questions, but ones that need to be considered.</p>

<p>The truth is it’s a messy process, fluid and interpretive. It requires intuition and hunches, but most importantly, inspiration and a connection to the work that runs deeper than textbook understanding.

<p>What are <a href="https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/neutron_stars1.html">neutron stars</a>? When stars at least eight times more massive than the Sun exhaust all the fuel in their core through thermonuclear fusion reactions, the pressure of gravity causes them to collapse. The supernova explosion that results ejects most of the star’s material into the far reaches of space. What remains forms either a neutron star or a black hole.</p>

<p>I study neutron stars because of their rich range of astrophysical phenomena and the many areas of physics to which they are connected. What makes neutron stars extremely interesting is that each star is about 1.5 times the mass of the Sun, but only about 25km in diameter – the size of a single city. When you cram that much mass into such a small volume, the matter is more densely packed than that of an atomic nucleus. So, for example, while the nucleus of a helium atom has just two neutrons and two protons, a neutron star is essentially a single nucleus made up of 10<sup>57</sup> neutrons and 10<sup>56</sup> protons.</p>

<h2>Exotic physics impossible on Earth</h2>

<p>We can use neutron stars to probe properties of nuclear physics that cannot be investigated in laboratories on Earth. For example, some current theories predict that exotic particles of matter, such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/hyperon">hyperons</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/quark">deconfined quarks</a>, can appear at the high densities that are present in neutron stars. Theories also indicate that at temperatures of a billion degrees Celsius, protons in the neutron star become <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/superconductivity">superconducting</a> and neutrons, without charge, become <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/superfluid-can-climb-walls/">superfluid</a>. </p>

<p>The magnetic field of neutron stars is extreme as well, possibly the strongest in the universe, and billions of times stronger than anything created in laboratories. While the gravity at the surface of a neutron star may not be as strong as that near a black hole, neutron stars still create major distortions in spacetime and can be sources of gravitational waves, which were <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1993/press.html">inferred from research into neutron stars in the 1970s</a>, and <a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-gravitational-waves-and-why-their-discovery-is-such-a-big-deal-53239?sr=3">confirmed from black holes by the LIGO experiments</a> recently.</p>

<p>The main focus of NICER is to accurately measure the mass and radius of several neutron stars – and, although the telescope will observe other types of astronomical objects, those of us studying neutron stars hope NICER will provide us with unique insights into these fascinating objects and their physics. NICER will measure how the brightness of a neutron star changes according to its energy, and how it changes as the star rotates, revealing different parts of the surface. These observations will be compared to theoretical models based on properties of the star such as mass and radius. Accurate determinations of mass and radius will provide a vital test of nuclear theory.</p>

<h2>A GPS for deep space</h2>

<p>Another aspect of neutron stars that could prove important for future space travel is their rotation– and this will also be tested by NICER. Rotating neutron stars, known as pulsars, emit beams of radiation like a lighthouse and are seen to spin as fast as 716 times per second. This rotation rate in some neutron stars is more stable than the best atomic clocks we have on Earth. In fact, it is this characteristic of neutron stars that led to the discovery of the first planets outside our solar system in 1992 – <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/355145a0">three Earth-sized planets revolving around a neutron star</a>. </p>

<p>The NICER mission, using a part of the telescope called <a href="https://gameon.nasa.gov/projects/deep-space-x-ray-navigation-and-communication/">SEXTANT</a>, will test whether the extraordinary regularity and stability of neutron star rotation could be <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4842">used as a network of navigation beacons in deep space</a>. Neutron stars could thus serve as natural satellites contributing to a Galactic (rather than Global) Positioning System and could be relied upon by future manned and unmanned spacecraft to navigate among the stars.</p>

<p>NICER will operate for 18 months, but it is hoped that NASA will continue to support its operation afterwards, especially if it can deliver on its ambitious scientific goals. I hope so too, because NICER combines and greatly improves upon the invaluable capabilities of previous X-ray spacecraft – <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/xtegof.html">RXTE</a>, <a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/">Chandra</a>, and <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton">XMM-Newton</a> – that are used to uncover neutron stars’ mysteries and reveal properties of fundamental physics. </p>

<p>The first neutron star, a pulsar, was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/universe/scientists/jocelyn_bell_burnell">discovered in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell Burnell</a>. It would be fitting to obtain a breakthrough on neutron stars in this 50th anniversary year.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80033/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

Most of them quietly disappeared during periods of “background extinction”, whereby a handful of species become extinct every 100,000 years or so. </p>

<p>But there were also occasions when extinction rates increased rapidly in short periods of time and wiped out a significant proportion of all life on Earth. These are known as mass extinctions. They have profoundly influenced the history of life – and many scientists now argue that we are <a href="https://theconversation.com/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-has-begun-new-study-confirms-43432">in the midst of another one</a>. To see if they’re right, we can look at previous occasions when large numbers of species went extinct. </p>

<p>Traditionally, scientists have referred to the “Big Five” mass extinctions, including perhaps the most famous mass extinction that brought about the <a href="https://theconversation.com/did-a-burning-oil-spill-wipe-out-the-dinosaurs-62456?sr=8">end of the dinosaurs</a>. This was triggered by a meteorite impact at the end of the Cretaceous period, but the other major mass extinctions were caused by phenomena originating entirely on Earth.

<p>This ancient crisis around 445m years ago saw two major waves of extinction, both caused by climate change associated with the advance and retreat of <a href="http://annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.earth.29.1.331">ice sheets in the southern hemisphere</a>. This makes it the only major extinction to be linked to global cooling. </p>

<p>This extinction caused the demise of around 57% of marine genera (<a href="https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1438-classification-system">the taxonomic rank</a> above the species level), including many <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Trilobite">trilobites</a>, shelled <a href="http://www.bgs.ac.uk/discoveringGeology/time/fossilfocus/brachiopod.html">brachiopods</a>, and eel-like <a href="http://www.le.ac.uk/gl/map2/abstractsetc/RWwww.html">conodonts</a>.</p>

<h2>2. The Late Devonian</h2>

<p>This period is now regarded as a number of “pulses” of extinction <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/extinction_events/Late_Devonian_extinction">spread over 20m years</a>, beginning 380m years ago. It saw the extinction of around 50% of marine genera; among the species killed off were many corals, trilobites, sponges and the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/22/10131.short">heavily armoured fish known as placoderms</a>. This extinction has been linked to major climate change, possibly caused by an eruption of the volcanic <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X10006321">Viluy Traps</a> area in modern-day Siberia. A major eruption might have caused <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018208001697">rapid fluctations in sea levels</a> and reduced oxygen levels in the oceans.</p>

<h2>3. The Middle Permian</h2>

<p>Scientists have recently <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018212007018">discovered another event 262m years ago</a> that rivals the “Big Five” in size. This event coincided with the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987113001072">Emeishan eruption</a> in what’s now China, and is known to have caused <a href="http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/127/9-10/1411.short">simultaneous extinctions in the tropics and higher latitudes</a>. In particular, there were exceptionally high extinction rates: <a href="http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/127/9-10/1411.short">more than 80%</a> of species were wiped out, among them brachiopods and single-celled <a href="http://www.sepmstrata.org/page.aspx?pageid=721">benthic foraminifera</a>.</p>

<h2>4. The Late Permian</h2>

<p>The Late Permian mass extinction around 252m years ago dwarfs all the other events, with <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534703000934">about 96% of species becoming extinct</a>. This included more trilobites, corals, and whole branches of species of terrestrial animals. The extinction was triggered by a vast eruption of the <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/siberian-traps-end-permian-extinction-0916">Siberian Traps</a>, a gigantic and prolonged volcanic event that covered much of modern day Siberia, which led to a cascade of environmental effects. </p>

<p>A greenhouse effect rapidly took hold in the atmosphere, while the oceans suffered acidification and oxygen depletion. The ozone layer was partially destroyed, meaning lethal levels of UV radiation reached the Earth’s surface. The recovery took <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n6/abs/ngeo1475.html">almost 10m years</a> and even then, the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6105/366">unstable environment</a> this catastrophic crisis created meant the subsequent Triassic period saw intermittent bursts of heightened extinction.</p>

<h2>5. The Late Triassic</h2>

<p>The Late Triassic event, 201m years ago, shares a number of similarities with the Late Permian event. It was caused by another large-scale eruption, this time of the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6135/941">Central Atlantic Magmatic Province</a>, which heralded the splitting of the supercontinent <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/earth/earth_timeline/pangaea">Pangaea</a> and the initial opening of what would later become the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>A similar <a href="http://specialpapers.gsapubs.org/content/early/2014/06/10/2014.2505_02.abstract">cascade of environmental effects</a>, as seen during the Late Permian, led to the extinction of around 47% of all genera. The extinction led to the final demise of the eel-like <a href="http://www.le.ac.uk/gl/map2/abstractsetc/RWwww.html">conodonts</a>, as well as the largest known extinction of <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/cnidaria/scleractinia.html">scleractinian corals</a>. It also wiped out a significant proportion of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8980">terrestrial reptiles and amphibians</a>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-evidence-that-volcanic-eruptions-triggered-the-dawn-of-the-dinosaurs-79729?sr=2">paving the way</a> for the diversification of the dinosaurs in the Jurassic period.</p>

<h2>A mass extinction in slow motion</h2>

<p>So, are we currently in the middle of a mass extinction? If we really are, this time the cause is not a meteorite impact or volcanic eruptions. It is the work of a single species: <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Habitat destruction and climate change from rising carbon dioxide levels has driven extinction rates to levels <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v471/n7336/abs/nature09678.html">reminiscent of the mass extinctions of the ancient past</a>.</p>

<p>The similarities between today and the past are uncanny. The majority of past extinctions are associated with carbon dioxide from volcanoes causing rapid global warming, which led to a number of environmental cascade effects. The cause may be different, but the results will be the same.</p>

<p>However, it is now 66m years since the last mass extinction. Earth’s ecosystems are very different, and perhaps more stable given the length of time elapsed since the last major biotic crisis. The position of the continents has changed, meaning atmospheric and ocean circulation are different; that makes it very difficult to use past data to predict the outcomes of any future mass extinctions.</p>

<p>Current extinction rates are <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/5/e1400253.short">50 times higher than expected background rates</a>, suggesting that another mass extinction event is underway. But mass extinctions are also about magnitude: if we could travel millions of years into the future and examine rocks preserving today’s ecosystems, I’d wager we’d see little evidence of a major extinction event.</p>

While all these have failed, the government in Turkey has now <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-40384471">banned evolution from its national curriculum</a>.</p>

<p>US creationists want both views to be presented, to let children decide what to believe. Bids to reject this are wrongly characterised as attempts to shut down debate or free speech – to promote a scientific, atheistic, secular, ideology over a more moral, ethical, commonsense religious worldview.</p>

<p>Turkey’s decision goes much further. This isn’t about claiming equal treatment, it’s an outright ban. The government justifies it by claiming evolution is “difficult to understand” and “controversial”. Any controversy however is one manufactured by ultra-religious communities seeking to undermine science. Many concepts in science are more difficult than evolution, yet they still get taught.</p>

<h2>Creationist arguments</h2>

<p>Evolution, creationists argue, is just a theory – it’s not proven and so up for debate. Evolutionary trees (especially for humans) are regularly re-drawn after new fossil discoveries, showing how poor the theory is. After all, if the theory was correct, this wouldn’t keep changing. Often, creationists will pose a challenge for science to prove how life started, knowing that there is not yet a firm, accepted theory. Finally, there’s the king of all arguments: if we all evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?</p>

<p>These arguments are packed with factual inaccuracies and logical fallacies. Evolution doesn’t need an explanation of how life started. It simply describes how life develops and diversifies. Humans did not evolve from monkeys – we‘re great apes. Modern apes, including humans, evolved from now extinct pre-existing ape species. We’re related to, not descended from, modern apes.</p>

<h2>Key creationist misconceptions</h2>

<p>Creationists fail to understand that evolution itself is not a theory. Evolution happens. Life develops and diversifies, <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/evolution-watching-speciation-occur-observations/">new species come into existence</a>. We can see intermediate life forms right now, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/02/crawling-breathing-invasive-fish-a-major-disaster-if-it-reaches-australia">fish that are transitioning to living on land</a> and <a href="http://www.manatee-world.com/manatee-evolution/">land mammals that recently transitioned into aquatic life</a>. The “theory of evolution” explains how evolution takes place. Charles Darwin and <a href="http://wallacefund.info/">Alfred Russel Wallace</a> first described the mechanism that drives the change - natural selection - in 1858.</p>

<p>Creationists also fail to understand the difference between a theory and a law in science. This is something that even science graduates suffer from, <a href="https://evolution-outreach.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1936-6434-6-12">as I’ve noted in my own research</a>. Theories explain scientific concepts. They are evidenced and accepted by the scientific community. Theories are the pinnacle of scientific explanation, not just a hunch or a guess. Laws however have a different role, they describe natural phenomena. For example, Newton’s laws of gravity do not explain how gravity happens, they describe the effects gravity has on objects. There are laws and theories for gravity. In biology however, there are few laws, so there is no law of evolution. Theories do not, given sufficient proof, become laws. They are not hierarchical.</p>

<p>A third issue is the lack of understanding of the nature of science. Science aims not to find some objective truth, but to elicit an explanation of natural phenomena. All scientific explanations are provisional. When new evidence is found that contradicts what we think we know, we change our explanations, sometimes rejecting theories that were once thought to be correct. Science is always working to try and falsify ideas. The more those ideas pass our tests, the more robust they are and the greater our confidence is that they are correct. Evolution has been tested for nearly 160 years. It’s never been falsified. Science only deals with natural phenomena, it doesn’t deal with or seek to explain the supernatural.</p>

<h2>Why the ban is dangerous</h2>

<p>Banning good science undermines all science, especially considering evolution’s place underpinning modern biology, with plenty of evidence to support it. For mainstream scientists, the fact that evolution happens is neither seriously questioned nor controversial. Any controversy in discussions of evolution resides in the role natural selection has in driving diversity and change, or the pace of that change.</p>

<p>This ban on teaching evolution in Turkish schools opens up the possibility that alternative, unscientific ideas may enter science teaching, from those who believe in a flat earth to deniers of gravity. </p>

<p>How do we deal with the apparent schism between religious belief and scientific evidence?</p>

<p>My <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00219266.2014.943790?journalCode=rjbe20">research</a> and approach has been to distinguish between religion, a belief system, and science, which works on the acceptance of evidence. Beliefs, including but not limited to religious beliefs, are often held irrationally, without evidence, and are resistant to change. Science is rational, based on evidence and is open to change when faced with new evidence. In science, we accept the evidence, rather than “choose to believe”.</p>

<p>Turkey’s move to ban the teaching of evolution contradicts scientific thinking, and tries to turn the scientific method into a belief system – as if it were a religion. It seeks to introduce supernatural explanations for natural phenomena, and to assert that some form of truth or explanation for nature exists beyond nature. The ban is unscientific, undemocratic and should be resisted.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80123/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

While there is a very present fear of insecurity these days, it’s rare that we celebrate security. But on the tenth anniversary of a revolutionary technology, we’d like to do just that: happy birthday to the iPhone, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7085643.stm">first released in June 2007</a>.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, a computer was something that hurt your foot if you accidentally dropped it. Mobile phones were devices that were chiefly used for making phone calls. Today, the idea that we can’t use these palm-sized pocket computers to command all our digital communications, and also as a camera, games console, torch, and a hundred other things, is quite unthinkable.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as complete security, and the iPhone is not perfect. Like many other technologies, the iPhone’s security relies on a user’s ability to choose and protect a strong password, which is a pragmatic rather than ideal basis for security. Researchers have also uncovered <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/garman">weaknesses in the protection of messages</a> stored on the iPhone. Nonetheless, in an era when the rush to market has resulted in far too many insecure technologies, the iPhone stands out as an exemplar for how it’s possible to do things right.</p>

<h2>A benevolent dictatorship</h2>

<p>The internet, in case you hadn’t noticed yet, can be a dangerous place. Apple has often been <a href="https://theconversation.com/ten-years-on-the-iphone-has-taken-us-back-as-many-steps-as-it-has-taken-us-forward-70988?sr=5">criticised for its restrictions</a> on what programs its users can and cannot load onto an iPhone. Users are required to download apps from the well-marshalled Apple App Store, which provides a secure gated compound within which software has been scrutinised by Apple before being made available for download.</p>

<p>While this may be seen as nannying, in a world of <a href="https://theconversation.com/nhs-ransomware-cyber-attack-was-preventable-77674?sr=2">ruthless ransomware</a> and untold other malicious programs that can ruin both our computers, our bank accounts, and even our lives – what’s wrong with a benign governess? The Android app store by comparison allows users to install any software of their choice, not all of which has been closely inspected for vulnerabilities or malicious intent.</p>

<h2>Getting cryptography right</h2>

<p>The iPhone makes extensive use of state-of-the-art cryptography to protect data on the device. Cryptography provides mathematical tools to ensure secret data is kept secret, ensuring data is not maliciously altered or deleted, and identifies the source of data. Cryptography is easy to get wrong when used in a computer, but the iPhone mostly gets cryptography right. Everything from photos, messages, email and app data is protected using strong cryptography. The iPhone also supports innovative applications of cryptography, such as the contactless payment system ApplePay.</p>

<p>Cryptography relies on cryptographic keys, which are secret components critical to providing secure services, and security. Many of the spectacular past failures of security technology, for example the infamous <a href="https://threatpost.com/final-report-diginotar-hack-shows-total-compromise-ca-servers-103112/77170/">Diginotar hack</a>, have resulted from careless management of keys. There is no point, after all, in using the best lock to lock your front door, only to leave the key under the doormat. The iPhone has a secure hardware vault known as the Secure Enclave within which its critical keys are safely stored. In fact the keys are so safe that they are inaccessible even to Apple or any other companies involved in manufacturing iPhones.</p>

<h2>Standing up for privacy</h2>

<p>Which brings us to the matter of Apple’s <a href="https://theconversation.com/fbi-backs-off-from-its-day-in-court-with-apple-this-time-but-there-will-be-others-56932?sr=1">skirmish with the FBI</a>. Apple has been at the forefront of a much wider and more fundamental debate about security and privacy on the internet. </p>

<p>In one corner stand national security agencies and law enforcement. They have been <a href="https://theconversation.com/investigatory-powers-bill-will-remove-isps-right-to-protect-your-privacy-50178?sr=2">demanding the means to access data</a> secured on mobile phones, including <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-whatsapp-encryption-works-and-why-there-shouldnt-be-a-backdoor-75266?sr=6">encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp</a> and emails, in order to defend the realm. In the other corner stand proponents of digital freedom. They argue that building “backdoors” into strong encryption even for legitimate use by investigators would <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-genie-is-out-of-the-bottle-its-foolish-to-think-encryption-can-now-be-banned-52395?sr=5">become a potential weakness for cybercriminals to exploit</a>. </p>

<p>Apple has <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-apple-is-making-a-stand-against-the-fbi-54925?sr=3">not shied away from taking a strong stance</a> in favour of privacy. Apple does not know the keys on your iPhone, or the PIN needed to unlock it, by design. That protects you from Apple, just as much as it prevents Apple handing them over to law enforcement. The iPhone was designed to be secure, so why make it insecure just because bad guys sometimes use them?</p>

<p>Apple’s security design decisions haven’t always made them popular, especially among its community of developers or with government agencies. But, unlike many of its competitors, the iPhone is a personal device which is just as secure for children and grandparents to use as it is for the few these days who really understand how the technology works. That’s something to celebrate, not bemoan. So, many happy returns to the iPhone, perhaps the closest we’ve come to having a secure computer in our pocket.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80104/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

The idea is that by understanding emotional behaviour, Facebook can show us more of what we react positively to in our Facebook news feeds and less of what we do not – whether that’s friends’ holiday photos, or advertisements.</p>

<p>This might appear innocuous, but consider some of the detail. In addition to smiles, joy, amazement, surprise, humour and excitement, the patent also lists negative emotions. Possibly being read for signs of disappointment, confusion, indifference, boredom, anger, pain and depression is neither innocent, nor fun.</p>

<p>In fact, Facebook is no stranger to using data about emotions. Some readers might remember the furore when <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4066473/">Facebook secretly tweaked user’s news feeds</a> to understand “emotional contagion”. This meant that when users logged into their Facebook pages, some were shown content in their news feeds with a greater number of positive words and others were shown content deemed as sadder than average. This changed the emotional behaviour of those users that were “infected”.</p>

<p>Given that Facebook has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/1/14474534/facebook-earnings-q4-fourth-quarter-2016">around two billion users</a>, this patent to read emotions via cameras is important. But there is a bigger story, which is that the largest technology companies have been buying, researching and developing these applications for some time. </p>

<h2>Watching you feel</h2>

<p>For example, <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/01/07/apple-emotient-acquisition/">Apple</a> bought Emotient in 2016, a firm that pioneered facial coding software to read emotions. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/emotion/">Microsoft</a> offers its own “cognitive services”, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/10/watson-has-more-accurate-emotion-detection/">IBM’s Watson</a> is also a key player in industrial efforts to read emotions. It’s possible that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601654/amazon-working-on-making-alexa-recognize-your-emotions/">Amazon’s Alexa voice-activated assistant</a> could soon be listening for signs of emotions, too.</p>

<p>This is not the end though: interest in emotions is not just about screens and worn devices, but also our environments. Consider retail, where increasingly the goal is to understand who we are and what we think, feel and do. Somewhat reminiscent of Steven Spielberg’s 2002 film Minority Report, <a href="https://www.eyeqinsights.com/go/">eyeQ Go</a>, for example, measures facial emotional responses as people look at goods at shelf-level.</p>

<p>What these and other examples show is that we are witnessing a rise of interest in our emotional lives, encompassing any situation where it might be useful for a machine to know how a person feels. Some less obvious examples include <a href="https://www.mysteryvibe.com/en">emotion-reactive sex toys</a>, the use of video cameras by lawyers to <a href="https://www.affectiva.com/success-story/mediarebel/">identify emotions in witness testimony</a>, and <a href="https://www.affectiva.com/what/uses/automotive/">in-car cameras and emotion analysis</a> to prevent accidents (and presumably to lower insurance rates).</p>

<h2>Users are not happy</h2>

<p>In a report assessing the rise of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzU2NrGCFp7qd0tOWjJDcFgxdGc/view">“emotion AI” and what I term “empathic media”</a>, I point out that this is not innately bad. There are already <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ErinReynolds/20160511/272295/Biofeedback_and_Gaming_The_Future_Is_Upon_Us_Seriously.php">games that use emotion-based biofeedback</a>, which take advantage of eye-trackers, facial coding and wearable heart rate sensors. These are a lot of fun, so the issue is not the technology itself but how it is used. Does it enhance, serve or exploit? After all, the scope to make emotions and intimate human life machine-readable has to be treated cautiously.</p>

<p>The report covers views from industry, policymakers, lawyers, regulators and NGOs, but it’s useful to consider what ordinary people say. I conducted a survey of 2,000 people and asked questions about emotion detection in social media, digital advertising outside the home, gaming, interactive movies through tablets and phones, and using voice and emotion analysis through smartphones.</p>

<p>I found that more than half (50.6%) of UK citizens are “not OK” with any form of emotion capture technology, while just under a third (30.6%) feel “OK” with it, as long as the emotion-sensitive application does not identify the individual. A mere 8.2% are “OK” with having data about their emotions connected with personally identifiable information, while 10.4% “don’t know”. That such a small proportion are happy for emotion-recognition data to be connected with personally identifying information about them is pretty significant considering what Facebook is proposing.</p>

<p>But do the young care? I found that younger people are twice as likely to be “OK” with emotion detection than the oldest people. But we should not take this to mean they are “OK” with having data about emotions linked with personally identifiable information. Only 13.8% of 18- to 24-year-olds accept this. Younger people are open to new forms of media experiences, but they want meaningful control over the process. Facebook and others, take note.</p>

<h2>New frontiers, new regulation?</h2>

<p>So what should be done about these types of technologies? UK and European law is being strengthened, especially given the introduction of the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulation</a>. While this has little to say about emotions, there are strict codes on the use of personal data and information about the body (biometrics), especially when used to infer mental states (as Facebook have proposed to do). </p>

<p>This leaves us with a final problem: what if the data used to read emotions is not strictly personal? What if shop cameras pick out expressions in such a way as to detect emotion, but not identify a person? This is what retailers are proposing and, as it stands, there is nothing in the law to prevent them.</p>

<p>I suggest we need to tackle the following question: are citizens and the reputation of the industries involved best served by covert surveillance of emotions?</p>

<p>If the answer is no, then codes of practice need to be amended immediately. Questions of ethics, emotion capture and rendering bodies passively machine-readable is not contingent upon personal identification, but something more important. Ultimately, this is a matter of human dignity, and about what kind of environment we want to live in. </p>

<p>There’s nothing definitively wrong with technology that interacts with emotions. The question is whether they can be shaped to serve, enhance and entertain, rather than exploit. And given that survey respondents of all ages are rightfully wary, it’s a question that the people should be involved in answering.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80153/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

They’ve been living there quietly for weeks. Perhaps you tried to get rid of them – especially if they were taking sugar from the kitchen or crawling across your bedroom. Perhaps you ignored them, or marvelled at their ability to navigate over apparently featureless paving stones back to their nest.</p>

<p>Then we have a spell of warm weather, a summer downpour, and when it stops there are winged explorers erupting from the ground – welcome to flying ant day.</p>

<p>But what exactly is flying ant day? For a start, it isn’t just one day. <a href="https://www.rsb.org.uk/get-involved/biologyweek/flying-ant-survey">Recent surveys</a> have shown that winged ants emerge over several weeks, although there are usually several large peaks. This is what happened in 2016, with many synchronised events in early August.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rsb.org.uk">The Royal Society of Biology</a> recently began working with entomologist <a href="http://www.glos.ac.uk/research/research-priority-areas/environmental-dynamics-and-governance/staff-profiles/pages/s2106030-adam-hart.aspx">Adam Hart</a> from the University of Gloucester (who studies insects). <a href="https://www.rsb.org.uk/get-involved/biologyweek/flying-ant-survey">He said</a>:</p>

<p>“Many people tend to think that there is one national flying ant day, and the media are keen to report it, but our research has shown that’s absolutely not the case. As in previous years we have seen many ‘flying ant days’ across the country this summer.”</p>

<p>Since swarming is triggered by temperature and often occurs after summer rain, ants over a large area can appear on the same day if conditions are similar across it. Millions can be on the wing, and after a short or much longer flight, can land anywhere – on trees, cars and clothing. Plenty more get eaten.</p>

<h2>Flights of fancy</h2>

<p>Flying ant day is a mating event or nuptial flight, and in Britain a common participant is the small black ant, <a href="http://www.naturespot.org.uk/species/small-black-ant"><em>Lasius niger</em> (Formicidae)</a>. <em>Lasius niger</em> builds its nests in soil, tree stumps or under paving stones, so patios are a favourite choice. </p>

<p>The colony starts with one or more mated queens. These tend the larvae until sufficient workers (less than half the size of the queen, and all sterile females) have developed. Usually only one queen survives and she will reproduce until the colony is 4,000-7,000 strong, which may take several years. Some large nests can have over 20,000 workers, which live for only a few months. Intriguingly, queens may survive for two decades or more and are thought to be the <a href="http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_34.shtml">longest lived of all adult insects</a>.</p>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>With plentiful food, each spring and summer the colony grows. Fertilised eggs normally develop into workers, but virgin queens are produced at high colony density, in a process determined by the queen. These new queens are winged, as are the males produced from unfertilised eggs. Males do not work, their only role is to <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/447/Ants-Mating-reproduction-life-span.html">fertilise a virgin queen</a>, and this often occurs on the wing.</p>

<p>Unlike honey bees, where the new queen takes over the colony and the old queen leaves with a swarm of workers, in <em>Lasius niger</em> and other ants, the old queen remains. Instead, hundreds of reproductive males and females (drones and “princesses”) emerge from the nest – hence flying ant day.</p>

<h2>What are the advantages?</h2>

<p>Basically: maximising genetic mixing, minimising losses to predators, and overcoming low probability of success. All ensure survival and dispersal of the species.</p>

<p>Genetic mixing is enhanced by virgin queens and drones first scattering. This is to maximise the chance of mating between different colonies to reduce inbreeding – something commented on by <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/published/1881_Worms_F1357/1876_CrossandSelfFertilisation_F1249/1876_CrossandSelfFertilisation_F1249.html">Charles Darwin in relation to plants</a>. (Remember that all the colony ants were produced by one queen, so have high genetic similarity.)</p>

<p>After dispersing, the “princesses” release pheromones to attract drones, but often play hard to get – they fly to escape converging males, allowing only the fastest and fittest to mate.</p>

<figure class="align-right ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/174496/width237/file-20170619-12400-3cekw5.jpg">

<p>Mass emergence does provide a rich food source, which can attract predators. However, massed prey benefit from <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/1938949/pdf">safety in numbers</a>, which reduces the likelihood of any one organism being eaten. If they present in small numbers they are more vulnerable, since this can train the predators, who will remain in the area. This is why other insects, <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/group/cicadas/">such as cicadas</a>, behave in the same way.</p>

<p>Even so, each potential queen has little chance of success. During its lifetime a large ant colony can disperse thousands of princesses, but on average only one will succeed. Which is probably just as well – otherwise, there would be very rapid growth in the number of ant colonies. Many succumb to predators: birds, dragonflies, often other ants, or die from starvation or environmental hazards. The first brood may fail, and the young colony can die out. Collectively, these mortality factors impose strong selection that ensures the queen has maximum fitness to produce the next generation. She also has to be lucky.</p>

<h2>The secret of a long life</h2>

<p>And what of the drones? Mating occurs in flight or on the ground, and since a queen usually mates with several males, this increases her offspring’s genetic diversity. The queen keeps a <a href="http://science.jrank.org/pages/447/Ants-Mating-reproduction-life-span.html#ixzz4kBHXft26">lifetime’s store of sperm</a> in an abdominal structure called a spermatheca, from which hundreds of thousands of eggs are fertilised. The drones, meanwhile, die in a day or two.</p>

<p>At the end of the nuptial flight, the fertilised queens land, chew off their wings and starts a new colony, where – if successful – they will stay for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>But how do queen ants live for so long? <em>Lasius niger</em> queens can live for over 25 years – and understanding why has interested researchers looking into the causes of ageing.

By one estimate, the market is <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/09/ais-37-billion-market-is-creating-new-industries/">projected to hit US$36.8 billion by 2025</a>. Some of this money will undoubtedly go to social good, like <a href="http://medicalfuturist.com/artificial-intelligence-will-redesign-healthcare/">curing illness, disease and infirmity</a>. Some will also go to better understanding intractable social problems like wealth distribution, urban planning, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/08/nvidia-ai-smart-cities-of-the-future/">smart cities</a>, and more “efficient” ways to do just about everything. But the key word here is “some”.</p>

<p>There’s no shortage of people touting the untold benefits of AI. But once you look past the utopian/dystopian and techno-capitalist hyperbole, what we are left with is a situation where various stakeholders want to find new and exciting ways to part you from your money. In other words: it’s business, not personal.</p>

<p>While the immediate benefits of AI might be clear from a strategic business perspective, the longer term repercussions are not. It’s not just that the future is impossible to predict, complex technologies are hard to control, and <a href="https://intelligence.org/stanford-talk/">human values are difficult to align with computer code</a>, it’s also that in the present it’s hard to hear the voices calling for temperance and judiciousness over the din of companies clamouring for market advantage.</p>

<p>This is neither a new nor recent phenomenon. Whether it was the social media boom, the smart phone “revolution”, or the commercialisation of the world wide web, if there’s money to be made, entrepreneurs will try and make it. And they should. For better or worse, economic prosperity and stability depends on what brilliance can be conjured up by scientific minds. </p>

<p>But that’s only one side of the coin. The flipside is that prosperity and stability can only be maintained if equally brilliant minds work together to ensure we have durable ways to govern these technologies, legally, ethically, and for the social good. In some cases, this might mean agreeing that there are simply certain things we should not do with AI; some things that profit should not be derived from. We might call this “<a href="https://www.consciouscapitalism.org/">conscious capitalism</a>” – but it is, in fact, now a societal imperative.</p>

<h2>#AIEthics</h2>

<p>There are structural problems in how the AI industry is shaping up, and serious asymmetries in the work that is being done. It’s all well and good for large companies invested in presenting themselves as the softer, cuddlier, but no less profitable, face of this new technological revolution to tout hashtags like #responsibleAI or #AIEthics. No rational person is object to either, but they should not distract from the fact that hashtags aren’t coherent policy. Effective policy costs money to research, devise, and implement – and right now, there is not enough time, cash, brainpower and undivided attention being devoted to building the robust governance infrastructure that will be required to compliment this latest wave of technological terraforming.</p>

<p>There are people out there thinking the things that need to be thought and implemented on the law, policy and governance side, but they are being drowned out by the PR, social media “influencers” and marketing campaigns that want to turn a profit from AI, or tell you how they can help your company do so. </p>

<p>Ultimately, our reach exceeds our grasp. We are far better at building new, exciting and powerful technologies than we are at governing them. To an extent, this has always been the case with new technologies, but the gap between what we create and the extent we can control it <a href="http://www.springer.com/gb/book/9789400713550">is widening and deepening</a>.</p>

<p>Over the course of my PhD, where I researched long term strategies for AI governance and regulation, I was offered some sage advice: “If you want to ensure you’re remembered as a fool, make predictions about the future.” While I try and keep that in mind, I am going to go out on a limb: AI will fundamentally remake society beyond all imagination. </p>

<p>Our commitment to ensuring safe and beneficial AI should amount to more than hashtags, handshakes and “changing the narrative”. It should be internalised into the ethos of AI development. Technical research must go hand in hand with law and policy research on both the public and private side. With great power comes great shared responsibility – and it’s about time we recognise that this is the best business model we have for AI going forward.</p>

<p>If we are going to try and socialise the benefits of AI across society – as the familiar refrain goes – we need to get serious about the distribution of money across the AI industry today. Public and private research and public engagement has a critical role to play in this, even if it’s easier (and cheaper) to co-opt it into in-house research. We need to build a robust government-led research infrastructure in the UK, Europe and beyond to meet head on the challenges AI and other “tech” will pose. This means we need to think about more than just about <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/big-data/">data protection</a>, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607955/inspecting-algorithms-for-bias/">algorithmic transparency and bias</a>. </p>

<p>We also need to get serious about how our legal and political institutions will need to adapt to meet the challenges of tomorrow. And they will need to adapt, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=979861">just as they have proven able to do</a> in the face of earlier technological changes, whether it was planes, trains, automobiles or computers. From legal personhood to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/25/tech-giants-no-contest-on-competition-law-amazon-whole-foods">antitrust laws</a>, or criminal culpability to corporate liability, we are starting to confront the incommensurability of certain legal norms with the lived reality of the 21st century.</p>

<h2>The challenges of tomorrow</h2>

<p>AI is a new type of beast. We cannot do governance as usual, which has meant waiting for the latest and greatest “tech” to appear and then frantically react to keep it in check. Despite protestations to the contrary, we must be proactive in engaging with AI development, not reactive. In the parlance of regulation, we need to think <em>ex ante</em> and not just <em>ex post</em>. The hands-off, we-are-just-a-platform-and-have-no-responsibility-here tone of Silicon Valley must be rejected once and for all.</p>

<p>If we are going to adapt our institutions to the 21st century we must understand how they have adapted before, and what can be done today to equip them for the challenges of tomorrow. These changes must be premised upon evidence; not fatalistic conceits about the machines taking over, not philosophical frivolity, not private interests. We need smart people on the law and policy side working with the smart people sitting at the keyboards and toiling in the labs at the companies where these engines of tomorrow are being assembled line by line. Some might see this as an unholy alliance, but it is, in fact, a noble goal.</p>

<p>The governance and regulation of AI is not a national issue; it is a global issue. The untold fortunes being poured into the technical side of AI research needs to start making its way into the hands of those devoted to understanding how we might best actualise the technology, and how we can in good conscience use it to solve problems where there is no profit to be made. </p>

<p>The risk we run is that AI research kick starts a new global arms race; one where finishing second is framed as tantamount to economic <em>hari-kari</em>. There is tremendous good that the AI industry can do to help change this, but so far these good intentions have not manifested themselves in ways conducive to building the robust law, policy and social-scientific infrastructure that must compliment the technical side. As long as this imbalance continues, be afraid. Be very afraid.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80100/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

This deliberate termination of a still serviceable spacecraft is to comply with “planetary protection” protocols, designed to minimise the risk of depositing stowaway Earth microbes into an environment where they might be able to reproduce.</p>

<p>The particular fear in this case is that if Cassini were allowed to become derelict in orbit it might eventually crash into Enceladus – a moon of Saturn now realised to have a watery <a href="https://theconversation.com/nasa-saturn-moon-enceladus-is-able-to-host-life-its-time-for-a-new-mission-76102">interior that is eminently habitable</a> for microbes. By similar reasoning, NASA’s first Jupiter orbiter <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galileo/">Galileo</a> was made to burn up in the planet’s atmosphere in 2003 rather than risk a future crash into its microbially habitable moon <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-water-plumes-from-jupiters-moon-europa-raise-hopes-of-detecting-microbial-life-66019">Europa</a>. The same fate awaits <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/overview/index.html">Juno</a> in February 2018.</p>

<p>This makes sense. When we eventually send landers capable of detecting life, it would be frustrating and potentially misleading if all they found was the descendants of microbes that we’d accidentally sent there ourselves. Apart from the science, there is the ethical question of whether we ought to “contaminate” alien ecosystems with bugs from Earth.</p>

<h2>Cleanliness is next to impossible</h2>

<p>You might think this risk could be eliminated by ensuring that the relevant spacecraft are scrupulously clean to begin with. However, despite using plasma (matter composed of electrically charged particles), intense radiation and heat to sterilise the components, and using special “clean rooms” to assemble them, it has proved impossible to construct a microbe-free spacecraft. The heat, cold, vacuum and harsh radiation encountered during spaceflight will kill most of them, but some will probably remain alive long enough to reach the destination. Experiments on the International Space Station have proved that spore-forming <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/eu_tef/">bacteria can remain viable in space</a> for at least as long as it takes to get to Mars.</p>

<p>The international regulatory body <a href="https://cosparhq.cnes.fr/">COSPAR</a> (Committee on Space Research) recognises the problem, and has <a href="https://cosparhq.cnes.fr/sites/default/files/pppolicy.pdf">protocols</a> governing missions travelling from the surface of one planetary body to another. These accept that the risk of accidental contamination cannot be entirely eliminated, and specify a maximum risk that can be tolerated in each circumstance. NASA <a href="https://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/overview">adheres to these rules</a> and other space-faring nations, including <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/28/asia/china-space-program-white-paper/index.html">China</a>, are signatories too.</p>

<p>The rules say that no Mars lander may carry more than 300,000 spores on its surface. A lander sent to a “special region”, where organisms might be able to feed and reproduce, has a much smaller permissible maximum of just 30. The logic is that 30 spores adhering to a spacecraft’s surface would be too few to cause contamination. </p>

<figure class="align-center ">

          </figure>

<p>For missions to Europa, which is thought to be the most habitable place in the solar system, the requirements are framed differently. They stipulate that the chances of inadvertent contamination of its internal ocean must be less than one in 10,000 per mission. </p>

<h2>Unrealistic standards?</h2>

<p>None of these rules have any force in law, and <a href="https://room.eu.com/article/The_new_space_ethics_COSPAR_Planetary_Protection_and_beyond_">there are fears</a> that they are liable to be be bent or broken on cost-saving grounds. Rather than leave them in place to be broken accidentally or deliberately breached by a “rogue” space agency, it would be better to have less stringent but more practicable protocols.</p>

<p>Certainly, as soon as you start sending humans to the surface of Mars, even the 300,000 spores rule goes (almost literally) out of the window. There are <a href="http://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/health/health-news/billions-of-bacteria-live-on-your-skin/news-story/0a23868c33945f26d4250c00058f494c">billions of microbes living on your skin</a>, and also on the skin of even the best-scrubbed Mars astronaut. As soon as an airlock is flushed, or a spacesuit that has been handled by a human touches the martian soil, some of these bugs will be out there, released into the atmosphere. Don’t forget also that these humans will be going to the toilet. Although they will be recycling their urine, their solid wastes will almost certainly be left on the planet to lighten the load for take-off back to space.</p>

<p>The COSPAR policy recognises these issues, in a hand-wringy sort of way. It requires humans to avoid “special regions” of Mars (including where liquid water is suspected at or near the surface), until a “comprehensive planetary protection protocol for human missions” has been developed. However, any human mission to Mars – whether it goes to plan or miscarries as in the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/follow-mark-watney-s-epic-trek-on-mars-with-new-nasa-web-tool">recent book and film The Martian</a> – would almost certainly have to break the rules.</p>

            <figcaption><span class="caption">‘Mark Watney’ on Mars. He survived by ruining Mars for future searches for life.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>What’s more, it is possible that much of the caution, at least where Mars is concerned, is unnecessary. There may already be Mars microbes on Earth, and also microbes from Earth on Mars. Though landers are unlikely to have caused this, these two planets orbit sufficiently close to each other that debris thrown up by asteroid impacts can make the journey from one to the other and then rain down as meteorites, carrying potentially viable microbes. </p>

            <figcaption><span class="caption">Could microbes travel naturally from Earth to Mars (and vice versa) on meteorites?</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>If we do eventually find life on Mars, we will want to be able to distinguish between the alternative possibilities of a common origin versus two independent origins. This means we must try to avoid accidental contamination that might confuse the evidence. </p>

<p>But we have to ask ourselves whether the current rules are too strict. Eventual contamination is inevitable, unless we give up completely.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/76657/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p><strong>Philip Hammond, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/cladding-used-on-grenfell-tower-is-banned-in-britain-chancellor-philip-hammond-claims-a3567541.html">speaking about</a> the Grenfell Tower fire on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show on June 18.</strong> </p>

<p>After the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower, the Metropolitan Police is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40380584">considering</a> whether to bring manslaughter (or other) charges relating to the tower block’s insulation, which it says failed safety tests. The cladding on another 11 high-rise buildings <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/government-tests-on-tower-blocks-reveal-combustible-cladding-10923147">has also</a> failed fire safety tests, according to the communities secretary, Sajid Javid. </p>

<p>Cladding is being added on tower blocks built in the 1960s and 1970s such as Grenfell Tower to improve the thermal performance of the flats and in some cases prevent material deteriorating and falling from the existing facades. These flats are often homes to some of the poorest in society and improving the facades may cut their energy bills to less than a half. This also means that they can adequately heat their homes to avoid condensation and mould growth inside.</p>

<p>The existing buildings have concrete or blockwork walls with a thin layer of insulation on the inner surface. The thermal improvement is achieved with a layer of insulation placed on the outer surface of the existing external wall where it is not impaired by condensation. Because of this, it is necessary to shelter the insulation from the weather. This is done with an outer layer of panels, called the rainscreen. A cavity is left between the insulation and the rainscreen to drain any water that passes joints in the rainscreen.</p>

<p>Fire may spread extensively up the wall if the insulation is combustible, if smoke and flame can travel up the cavity or if the rainscreen is combustible. In practice, fire barriers are placed in the cavity at each storey to prevent the movement of smoke and flame and separate the insulation into storey-height portions. This limits any spread of fire through the insulation which should be of limited combustibility in high rise buildings.</p>

<p>Many materials have been used for rainscreens in the UK, ranging from lightweight metal panels, through composite boards and terracotta to natural stone on upmarket city offices. Aluminium composite materials (ACM) are used as a lightweight economical solution that can be readily formed into different shapes with different surface finishes. </p>

<p>ACM comprises two metal skins (normally of aluminium) bonded on to a core of sheet material. Manufacturers make three grades of these material: polyethylene core (PE), which has the worst performance in fires and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/15/cladding-in-2014-melbourne-high-rise-blaze-also-used-in-grenfell-tower">has been linked</a> to major fires in other countries, and two higher-performance grades of material (FR and A2) which are based on cores with a mineral content and perform better in fires.</p>

<p>A polyethylene core will melt and catch fire, burning rapidly with a heat output in excess of 125 MJ/m2 – similar to the effect of burning an equivalent volume of diesel fuel. A fire will then spread rapidly up the façade while burning droplets may fall from the building and spread fire downwards. The loss of the rainscreen in a fire makes the fire barriers in the cavity ineffective and the insulation is more likely to burn and contribute to the fire spread.</p>

<h2>What the regulations say</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200135/approved_documents/63/part_b_-_fire_safety">Building Regulation part B</a> in England requires that all insulation and filler materials – a term that is not defined – in the wall of a high-rise building are of limited combustibility. The ACM panels do not fulfil the role of insulation and have no particular insulative properties. It is commonly argued, then, that they are not fillers. This confusion and the resulting loophole in the regulations mean that polyethylene core ACMs have been used on high-rise buildings ostensibly in compliance with Building Regulation B, as is the case at Grenfell Tower.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200135/approved_documents/84/regulation_7_-_materials_and_workmanship">Approved Document 7</a> of the Building Regulations requires that: “Materials are of a suitable nature and quality in relation to the purposes and conditions of their use.” This fitness-for-purpose is not well defined in the regulations. However, the manufacturers of ACM state that the PE version is not <a href="https://www.arconic.com/aap/europe/pdf/Our%20fire%20solutions_BR36EN_012017.pdf">suitable for use</a> above ten to 15 metres on a building because of its fire risk and also make mineral core alternatives that are suitable. </p>

<p>Regulations differ from country to country, even across Europe to the extent that building regulations in Scotland differ from those in England. European cladding consultants have expressed concern to me about the use of these materials in their countries.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>Hammond’s claim that the type of cladding used on Grenfell Tower is banned in the UK is nearly correct because of the less well-known Approved Document 7. But neither this document, nor Building Regulation B specifically bans the use of PE core ACM panels.</p>

<h2>Review</h2>

<p><strong>Masi Farjadmand, senior lecturer, Department of Property and Construction, University of Westminster</strong></p>

<p>This article contains certain amount of information from publicly available materials which are generally correct. I have no specific objections to the opinions expressed in it and the verdict is accurate. Vertical spread of fire from outside a building is a result of many factors. The material used for cladding and its combustibility is only one. The gap allowing the fire to move from one storey to the next, mostly upwards and sometimes down, is an important factor. </p>

<p>Approved Documents 7 and another British Standard Online document – <a href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030268793">BS 8000-6</a> – a code of practice for slating and tiling of roofs and claddings – provide general guidelines, as do all other standards. The cladding used for Grenfell Tower is not illegal to the letter of the law, but it may not comply to the spirit of either the law or the regulations. This will be a matter for investigators to determine. In the case of Grenfell Tower, many aspects of fire safety and fire engineering contributed to the spread of fire and the cladding is only one of them.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/79803/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

It wasn’t a long lost painting but a new artwork generated by a computer that had analysed thousands of works by the 17th-century Dutch artist Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn.</p>

<p>The computer used something called machine learning to analyse and reproduce technical and aesthetic elements in Rembrandt’s works, including lighting, colour, brush-strokes and geometric patterns. The result is a portrait produced based on the styles and motifs found in Rembrandt’s art but produced by algorithms. </p>

<p>This is just one example in a growing body of works generated by computers. A short novel written by a <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/japanese-ai-writes-novel-passes-first-round-nationanl-literary-prize/">Japanese computer program</a> in 2016 reached the second round of a national literary prize. The Google-owned artificial intelligence (AI) firm, Deep Mind, has created software that can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/09/googles-wavenet-uses-neural-nets-to-generate-eerily-convincing-speech-and-music/">generate music</a> by listening to recordings. Other projects have seen computers <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-artificial-intelligence-poetry">write poems</a>, <a href="https://deepdreamgenerator.com/gallery">edit photographs</a>, and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/01/beyond-the-fence-computer-generated-musical-greenham-common">compose a musical</a>. </p>

          </figure>

<p>But who owns creative works generated by artificial intelligence? This isn’t just an academic question. AI is already being used to generate works <a href="https://qz.com/790523/daddys-car-the-first-song-ever-written-by-artificial-intelligence-is-actually-pretty-good/">in music</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/03/artificla-intelligence-robot-reporter-pulitzer-prize">journalism</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/1/12/5295980/how-ai-game-developer-angelina-could-change-the-industry">and gaming</a>, and these works could in theory be deemed free of copyright because they are not created by a human author.</p>

<p>This would mean they could be freely used and reused by anyone and that would be bad news for the companies selling them. Imagine you invest millions in a system that generates music for video games, only to find that music isn’t protected by law and can be used without payment by anyone in the world.</p>

<p>Unlike with earlier computer-generated works of art, machine learning software generates truly creative works without human input or intervention. AI is not just a tool. While humans program the algorithms, the decision making – the creative spark – comes almost entirely from the machine.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean that copyright should be awarded to the computer, however. Machines don’t (yet) have the rights and status of people under the law. But that doesn’t necessarily mean there shouldn’t be any copyright either. Not all copyright is owned by individuals, after all.</p>

<p>Companies are recognised as legal people and are often awarded copyright for works they don’t directly create. This occurs, for example, when a film studio hires a team to make a movie, or a website commissions a journalist to write an article. So it’s possible copyright could be awarded to the person (company or human) that has effectively commissioned the AI to produce work for it.</p>

<figure class="align-center ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/174704/width754/file-20170620-24898-y8xanl.jpg">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>The current legal picture is actually more complicated, and it changes depending on where you live, as this is not an area that has been dealt with by international copyright treaties.</p>

<p>In the UK and other countries such as Ireland and New Zealand, computer-generated works do have copyright, <a href="www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/9">which belongs to</a> “the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken”. Other European countries lack similar provisions in their legislation, but various jurisdictions such as <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/es/details.jsp?id=1319">Spain</a> and <a href="https://dejure.org/gesetze/UrhG/7.html">Germany</a> imply that only works created by a human can be subject to copyright protection.</p>

<p>What’s more, <a href="curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-5/08">case law</a> from the European Court of Justice has declared on various occasions that copyright only applies to original works, and originality must reflect the “author’s own intellectual creation”. This is usually understood as meaning that an original work must reflect the author’s personality, which clearly means that a human author is necessary for a copyright work to exist. </p>

<h2>Human intervention needed</h2>

<p>In other jurisdictions, the situation is even more complicated. In Australia, <a href="www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2012/16.html">certain case law</a> has declared that a work generated with the intervention of a computer could not have copyright because it was not produced by a human. In the US, the situation is still open to argument, with various experts disagreeing on whether computer-generated works would be <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1888622">protected</a> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2699862">or not</a>.</p>

<p>Things are likely to become yet more complex as AI tools are more commonly used by artists and as the machines get better at reproducing creativity, making it harder to discern if an artwork is made by a human or a computer. Monumental advances in computing and the sheer amount of computational power becoming available may well make the distinction moot. At that point, we will have to decide what type of protection, if any, we should give to emergent works created by intelligent algorithms with little or no human intervention.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2981304">most sensible move</a> seems to follow those countries that grant copyright to the person who made the AI’s operation possible, with the UK’s model looking like the most efficient. This will ensure companies keep investing in the technology, safe in the knowledge they will reap the benefits. What happens when we start seriously debating whether computers should be given the status and rights of people is a whole other story.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/79449/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

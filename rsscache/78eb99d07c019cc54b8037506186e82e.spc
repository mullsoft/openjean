 <!--smart_paging_autop_filter--><p>The <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html">report</a> that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer last June in expectation of receiving damaging information on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is a blow for a White House already saddled with sinking poll numbers and a stalled legislative agenda.</p><p>After a few weeks of political news dominated by the fate of the Senate health care bill and Trump’s trip to Europe, the Russia investigation has resurfaced with a vengeance.</p><p>The <em>Times'</em> revelations disclose six new dangers facing Trump’s presidency.</p><p><strong>1. What did Trump know about the meeting?</strong></p><p>The meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred on June 9, 2016. Trump Jr.’s first explanation was the meeting only concerned U.S.-Russian adoption policies that had been disrupted by congressional approval of the Magnitsky Act, a law imposing sanctions on the Russian government and certain officials. In response, Russian president Vladimir Putin but the brakes on all American adoptions of Russian orphans.</p><p>When confronted with a second story saying Trump Jr. agreed to the meeting because Veselnitskaya had offered incriminating information on Clinton, the president’s son changed his tune. He admitted the subject had come up, but said Veselnitskaya offered no specifics, so he lost interest and the conversation returned to adoption.</p><p>In a sarcastic tweet, Trump Jr. said the talk “went nowhere.”</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en">Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen. <a href="https://t.co/ccUjL1KDEa">https://t.co/ccUjL1KDEa</a></p>— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/884395618784993280">July 10, 2017</a></blockquote><p>Was the substance of the Russian offer relayed to his father? Donald Trump was <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-amid-fundraising-worries-trump-gathers-potential-2016jun09-story.html">at Trump Tower</a>, the site of the meeting that day on June 9. He is known to have lunched with campaign manager Paul Manafort, who attended the meeting along with Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law.</p><p>Keith Olbermann points out that it was the afternoon of June 9 when Trump sent out his first tweet about Clinton’s emails.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en">You know what <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a> did the same day Jr, Manafort, Kushner met the Russian? He sent his 1ST tweet about Hillary's "33,000 emails" <a href="https://t.co/vAqUuB7tuM">pic.twitter.com/vAqUuB7tuM</a></p>— Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) <a href="https://twitter.com/KeithOlbermann/status/884396597584547840">July 10, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p><strong>2. Evidence of collusion.</strong></p><p>From <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/taibbi-russia-story-is-a-minefield-for-democrats-and-the-media-w471074">Matt Taibbi</a> on the left to <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2017/06/23/Sean-Hannity-If-Trump-campaign-communicated-with-and-asked-Russia-to-release-hacked-emails/217020">Sean Hannity</a> on the right, some pundits have complained that there is no evidence to support allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.</p><p>Yes, there were meetings, these critics say. Yes, they were unusual and perhaps even improper. Yes, the Trump campaign denied the meetings and then admitted them. But nothing about the meetings points to collusion—meaning “secret cooperation”—to influence the 2016 election.</p><p>Left or right, that argument is now much less credible.</p><p>If the June 9 discussion covered the Magnitsky Act, which Putin wanted repealed, and damaging information about Clinton, which Trump wanted revealed, then one has to wonder if there was a meeting of the minds, a quid pro quo, an exchange of favors in which the two sides agreed to secretly help the other. In a word, if there was collusion.</p><p>Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer for the Bush White House, said Trump Jr.'s behavior qualifies as criminal.</p><p>“If this story is true, we’d have one of them if not both of them in custody by now, and we’d be asking them <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/341223-ex-bush-ethics-lawyer-on-trump-jr-meeting-with-russian-lawyer-this">a lot of questions</a>,” Painter told MSNBC</p><p><strong>3. Manafort sings.</strong></p><p>A close reading of the <em>Times</em> story about the June 9 meeting indicates that Paul Manafort is talking to investigators about previously undisclosed meetings between the Trump campaign and the Russians.</p><p>Manafort, the <em>Times</em> reports, “recently disclosed the meeting, and Donald Trump Jr.’s role in organizing it, to congressional investigators who had questions about his foreign contacts, according to people familiar with the events.”</p><p>Manafort, a political consultant who recently acknowledged his consulting firm received <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/06/28/534765010/paul-manaforts-firm-received-17-1-million-from-ukrainian-political-party">$19 million</a> from pro-Putin forces in Ukraine, ran Trump's campaign from May to August 2016.</p><p>Last month, Nancy LeTourneau of the Washington Monthly made the case that Manafort has already turned <a href="http://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/06/28/has-muellers-team-flipped-paul-manafort/">state’s witness</a>. The <em>Times'</em> story lends credence to that theory.</p><p><strong>4. The 'modified limited hangout.'</strong></p><p>During the Watergate scandal of the 1970s that brought down President Richard Nixon, adviser John Ehrlichman suggested the president respond to a round of damaging revelations with what he called a “modified limited hangout." This is the “strategy of mixing partial admissions with misinformation and resistance to further investigation.”</p><p>The Trump White House is now in modified limited hangout mode. The <em>Times</em> story did not come from the president's enemies or anonymous sources in the intelligence community. It was attributed to “three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it.”</p><p>Unable to deny the substance of the story of the June 9 meeting, all the president’s men are confirming it, the better to assert that the president was not involved.</p><p>“My father knew nothing of these meetings and these events,” Trump Jr. said in a statement.</p><p>What Manafort has to say about his June 9 meetings with the Russian lawyer and with Trump is not known—yet.  </p><p><strong>5. Allies retreat.</strong></p><p>As the “no evidence of collusion” argument collapses, the president’s allies are retreating to a <a href="https://lawfareblog.com/thoughts-collusion-and-its-interactions-crime">new line of defense</a>: collusion is not a crime. Hannity started offering this argument last week, as did Fox News anchor Brit Hume.</p><p>“Can anybody identify the crime?” Hume <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2017/06/25/foxs-brit-hume-even-if-trump-campaign-did-collude-russia-it-s-not-crime/217024">said</a>. “Collusion, while it would be obviously alarming and highly inappropriate for the Trump campaign, of which there is no evidence by the way, of colluding with the Russians. It's not a crime."</p><p>The argument is not legally implausible. Secret cooperation with a foreign government isn’t, by itself, a violation of the law. But the changing defense is a sign that the president’s case is failing factually.</p><p>As the <a href="https://able2know.org/topic/98689-1">old courtroom adage</a> holds, "If the facts are against you, argue the law. If the law is against you, argue the facts. If the law and the facts are against you, pound the table and yell like hell."</p><p>Or in the 21st century: pound the media and tweet like hell.</p><p><strong>6. Family implicated.</strong></p><p>Until now the Russian investigation has illuminated the curious actions of Trump’s outer ring of advisers.</p><p>Michael Flynn, the fired national security adviser, lied about his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States. Attorney General Jeff Sessions failed to disclose his own meetings with Russian officials during the campaign. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner failed to disclose meetings with Russians after the election when applying for a security clearance.</p><p>Now that the scandal has touched Trump’s son, his own flesh and blood, the Russia investigation has drawn blood for the first time.</p> <!-- iCopyright Interactive Copyright Notice -->

Evidence of collusion.</strong></p><p>From <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.rollingstone.com/politics/taibbi-russia-story-is-a-minefield-for-democrats-and-the-media-w471074">Matt Taibbi</a> on the left to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2017/06/23/Sean-Hannity-If-Trump-campaign-communicated-with-and-asked-Russia-to-release-hacked-emails/217020">Sean Hannity</a> on the right, some pundits have complained that there is no evidence to support allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.</p><p>Yes, there were meetings, these critics say. Yes, they were unusual and perhaps even improper. Yes, the Trump campaign denied the meetings and then admitted them. But nothing about the meetings points to collusion—meaning “secret cooperation”—to influence the 2016 election.</p><p>Left or right, that argument is now much less credible.</p><p>If the June 9 discussion covered the Magnitsky Act, which Putin wanted repealed, and damaging information about Clinton, which Trump wanted revealed, then one has to wonder if there was a meeting of the minds, a quid pro quo, an exchange of favors in which the two sides agreed to secretly help the other. In a word, if there was collusion.</p><p>Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer for the Bush White House, said Trump Jr.&#039;s behavior qualifies as criminal.</p><p>“If this story is true, we’d have one of them if not both of them in custody by now, and we’d be asking them <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~thehill.com/homenews/administration/341223-ex-bush-ethics-lawyer-on-trump-jr-meeting-with-russian-lawyer-this">a lot of questions</a>,” Painter told MSNBC</p><p><strong>3. Manafort sings.</strong></p><p>A close reading of the <em>Times</em> story about the June 9 meeting indicates that Paul Manafort is talking to investigators about previously undisclosed meetings between the Trump campaign and the Russians.</p><p>Manafort, the <em>Times</em> reports, “recently disclosed the meeting, and Donald Trump Jr.’s role in organizing it, to congressional investigators who had questions about his foreign contacts, according to people familiar with the events.”</p><p>Manafort, a political consultant who recently acknowledged his consulting firm received <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.npr.org/2017/06/28/534765010/paul-manaforts-firm-received-17-1-million-from-ukrainian-political-party">$19 million</a> from pro-Putin forces in Ukraine, ran Trump&#039;s campaign from May to August 2016.</p><p>Last month, Nancy LeTourneau of the Washington Monthly made the case that Manafort has already turned <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~washingtonmonthly.com/2017/06/28/has-muellers-team-flipped-paul-manafort/">state’s witness</a>. The <em>Times&#039;</em> story lends credence to that theory.</p><p><strong>4. The &#039;modified limited hangout.&#039;</strong></p><p>During the Watergate scandal of the 1970s that brought down President Richard Nixon, adviser John Ehrlichman suggested the president respond to a round of damaging revelations with what he called a “modified limited hangout." This is the “strategy of mixing partial admissions with misinformation and resistance to further investigation.”</p><p>The Trump White House is now in modified limited hangout mode. The <em>Times</em> story did not come from the president&#039;s enemies or anonymous sources in the intelligence community. It was attributed to “three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it.”</p><p>Unable to deny the substance of the story of the June 9 meeting, all the president’s men are confirming it, the better to assert that the president was not involved.</p><p>“My father knew nothing of these meetings and these events,” Trump Jr. said in a statement.</p><p>What Manafort has to say about his June 9 meetings with the Russian lawyer and with Trump is not known—yet.  </p><p><strong>5. Allies retreat.</strong></p><p>As the “no evidence of collusion” argument collapses, the president’s allies are retreating to a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://lawfareblog.com/thoughts-collusion-and-its-interactions-crime">new line of defense</a>: collusion is not a crime. Hannity started offering this argument last week, as did Fox News anchor Brit Hume.</p><p>“Can anybody identify the crime?” Hume <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2017/06/25/foxs-brit-hume-even-if-trump-campaign-did-collude-russia-it-s-not-crime/217024">said</a>. “Collusion, while it would be obviously alarming and highly inappropriate for the Trump campaign, of which there is no evidence by the way, of colluding with the Russians. It&#039;s not a crime."</p><p>The argument is not legally implausible. Secret cooperation with a foreign government isn’t, by itself, a violation of the law. But the changing defense is a sign that the president’s case is failing factually.</p><p>As the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://able2know.org/topic/98689-1">old courtroom adage</a> holds, "If the facts are against you, argue the law. If the law is against you, argue the facts. If the law and the facts are against you, pound the table and yell like hell."</p><p>Or in the 21st century: pound the media and tweet like hell.</p><p><strong>6. Family implicated.</strong></p><p>Until now the Russian investigation has illuminated the curious actions of Trump’s outer ring of advisers.</p><p>Michael Flynn, the fired national security adviser, lied about his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States. Attorney General Jeff Sessions failed to disclose his own meetings with Russian officials during the campaign. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner failed to disclose meetings with Russians after the election when applying for a security clearance.</p><p>Now that the scandal has touched Trump’s son, his own flesh and blood, the Russia investigation has drawn blood for the first time.</p> <!-- iCopyright Interactive Copyright Notice -->

 <!--smart_paging_autop_filter--><p dir="ltr">In language eerily reminiscent of the rhetoric of the fascist far right, New Atheist pundit Sam Harris has called for reducing the number of Muslims in society, warning on the January episode of his popular podcast, “You can’t have too many Muslims in your culture if you want it to remain enlightened.”</p><p dir="ltr">On the podcast, Harris echoed anti-refugee talking points and proposed figuring “out some way to keep the number of Muslims down in any society, whether we’re honest about this or whether we do this covertly.

As AlterNet’s Max Blumenthal and Nafeez Ahmed have <a href="http://www.alternet.org/grayzone-project/self-invention-maajid-nawaz-fact-and-fiction-life-counter-terror-celebrity">documented</a>, Nawaz concocted significant portions of his memoir and falsely branded members of his own family as Islamic extremists.</p><p dir="ltr">Nawaz issued his approval, declaring that Harris’ proposal to limit the Muslim population in the West, is “not irrational; it’s not even inhuman.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harris and Nawaz also bashed the left and called for more Western military intervention in the Middle East, despite it being the primary force driving <a href="http://www.alternet.org/grayzone-project/idlib-chemical-attack-al-qaeda-syria-trump">Salafi-jihadist violence</a> and the refugee crisis.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Well-established history of bigotry</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Sam Harris, who identifies as a liberal centrist, has previously said that the “people who speak most sensibly about the threat that Islam poses to Europe are <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/18/opinion/oe-harris18/2">actually fascists</a>." He has a long history of anti-Muslim extremism, going so far as to claim “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/dec/1/20041201-090801-2582r/">we are at war</a> with Islam.”</p><p dir="ltr">The popular leader of the so-called New Atheists has also openly stated, “We should <a href="http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/in-defense-of-profiling">profile Muslims</a> or anyone who looks like he or she could conceivably be Muslim, and we should be honest about it.”</p><p dir="ltr">The January episode of Harris’ podcast is not the first time he has flirted with racist talking points. It was soon followed by another episode in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1lEPQYQk8s&amp;feature=youtu.be">April</a>, in which Harris advanced rhetoric that resembles the pseudoscientific “race realism” of white supremacists. Harris <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/5/18/15655638/charles-murray-race-iq-sam-harris-science-free-speech">maintained</a> that “average IQ differs across races and ethnic groups,” implying that people of African descent have lower IQs, while people of European descent are smarter.</p><p dir="ltr">Harris, who has also harshly criticized the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqRzWjqXFWo">Black Lives Matter</a> movement as “irrational,” staunchly maintains he is not racist, and has gone out of his way to condemn white supremacists. His IQ comments, however, were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGp06vMPERE&amp;feature=youtu.be">applauded by white nationalists</a> and the rebranded fascist movement that calls itself the alt-right.</p><p dir="ltr">The April episode featured an extended interview with Charles Murray, a notorious <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/26/opinion/in-america-throwing-a-curve.html">right-wing</a> academic who did secret counterinsurgency work with the U.S. government during the Vietnam War. His work helped create the racist system of mass incarceration and he successfully campaigned to dismantle welfare programs.</p><p dir="ltr">In the January episode, both Harris and Nawaz praised another Murray: the neoconservative British writer Douglas Murray, who wrote an book titled <em>The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam</em>, which laments that Europe is becoming less <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/06/strange-death-europe-immigration-xenophobia">white and Christian</a>, and calls for far-right anti-immigration policies as an antidote. Harris cited Douglas Murray multiple times, and referred to him as a “mutual friend” with Nawaz.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9EB908NRdCc" width="620"></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>'What is the f**king point of having more Muslims in your society?'</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Sam Harris has a longtime habit of running away from his own words, accusing critics of taking his extreme statements out of context. This latest episode is no exception. Thus, the timestamps for comments quoted in this article show that they were quoted accurately and in context.</p><p dir="ltr">In a segment that begins at 1:11:00 in the January podcast episode, Harris made a lengthy argument for restricting Muslim migration into Western societies, using right-wing talking points drawn from those used to justify racial quotas in immigration centuries ago. Harris said his anti-immigrant bigotry was simply the “gut reaction that I know millions upon millions of people are having,” in response to attacks by Salafi-jihadist militants.</p><p dir="ltr">“If you take a community of Muslims from Syria or Iraq or any other country on Earth and place them in the heart of Europe, you are importing, by definition, some percentage, however small, of radicalized people, or people who will be prone to radicalism at some future date where they just decide to start watching too many Anwar al-Awlaki videos,” Harris said at 1:11:50. “And again, this only happens to Muslims or people who are likely to become Muslim.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harris went on, at 1:12:26: “I think many people will feel, what is the f**king point of having more Muslims in your society? It seems perfectly rational to say, we don’t want any more. We have enough. And certainly increasing the percentage is not a help to anyone who loves freedom of speech and anything else, any of the other liberal values.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s not worth the trouble,” Harris continued. “And if we can figure out some way to keep the number of Muslims down in any society, whether we’re honest about this or whether we do this covertly. Clearly it’s rational to want to do this.”</p><p dir="ltr">“This is where someone like Robert Spencer would say amen, I would presume,” he added, referring positively to a far-right anti-Muslim extremist who was banned from traveling to the U.K. due to comments the British government said incite violence.</p><p dir="ltr">“This is not an expression of xenophobia,” Harris insisted. “This is an expression of the implication of statistics and the fact that it’s only rational not to want to live in a world that looks more and more like Jerusalem at the height of the Intifada.”</p><p dir="ltr">Nawaz agreed. “Yes,” he said, “It’s not irrational; it’s not even inhuman, for people to react that way.” He then proceeded to attack “the political left.”</p><p dir="ltr">Nawaz added that this xenophobia is “natural”....It’s a very human response. People like familiarity. People like a sense of predictability around their environment and the culture that they expect others to adhere to.” He claimed “ideologues on the left” are “in denial” about this natural bigotry.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Anti-Muslim double standard</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Harris openly acknowledged in the podcast that he maintains a double standard against Muslims. In an attempt to shield himself from accusations of racism, Harris noted at 1:15:04 that if an Indian family moved next door, he would have no problem; he would in fact welcome them.</p><p dir="ltr">But if these new neighbors were Muslim, Harris said he would be concerned: “What I worry about is bad beliefs.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harris made it clear that his animus against Muslims is exceptional. He went out of his way to claim that there is an “Islamic exceptionalism” — that Islam has uniquely bad “special challenges” other religions do not have. Nawaz said “yeah” in agreement.</p><p dir="ltr">Harris then, at 1:22:55, suggested that Germany could accept migrants from Spain and Portugal to be used as labor, but not from Muslim-majority countries.</p><p dir="ltr">The “fundamental concern” is that “once you get a sufficient percentage of Muslims in any society,” Harris explained at 1:23:09, “the character of that community begins to change.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s just a formula for religious oppression, getting enough Muslims in your society, however they got there originally,” Harris continued. “You can’t have too many Muslims in your culture if you want it to remain enlightened.”</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Attacking antiracists and shieldings extremists</strong></p><p dir="ltr">For holding extreme views like those he expressed on Harris' podcast, the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/20161025/journalists-manual-field-guide-anti-muslim-extremists">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>, the leading monitor of hate groups in the U.S., has designated Maajid Nawaz an “anti-Muslim extremist.”</p><p dir="ltr">The so-called alt-right — a rebranding of white supremacy and neo-fascism— has viciously attacked the SPLC for documenting its racist machinations. Harris and Nawaz opened the January episode vociferously condemning the SPLC, branding the group as fascist for creating a list of right-wing extremists. Nawaz suggested he would pursue legal action against the group over its criticism of his public statements, and accused the SPLC of defamation.</p><p dir="ltr">In the episode, Harris refused to criticize Robert Spencer (not to be confused with white nationalist Richard Spencer), the Islamophobia industry godfather who also appeared on the SPLC’s anti-Muslim extremist list. Harris noted that Spencer is "unjustly stigmatized," and said he does not want to speak ill of him.</p><p dir="ltr">Robert Spencer is a far-right fanatic who has advanced a number of outlandish conspiracies, including the myth that former president Barack Obama is secretly Muslim. As the SPLC highlighted in its listing, Spencer has condemned multiculturalism as “heresy” that will result in “denigrating and ultimately destroying the Judeo-Christian West.”</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer has glowingly endorsed numerous neo-fascist politicians, including the Netherlands’ Geert Wilders and France’s Jean-Marie Le Pen. He has also recommended the genocidal fantasy novel <em>Camp of the Saints</em>, also a favorite of Donald Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon.</p><p dir="ltr">Amid his calls for fewer Muslims in the West, Sam Harris went out of his way to emphasize to listeners of his podcast that he opposes the term “Islamophobia,” insisting its very existence is mythical. But as usual, his own words contradict him. </p><p dir="ltr"><em>This is Part I of a three-part series on Sam Harris​ and his allies.</em><em> Stay tuned for more this week.</em></p> <!-- iCopyright Interactive Copyright Notice -->

Clearly it’s rational to want to do this.”</p><p dir="ltr">“This is where someone like Robert Spencer would say amen, I would presume,” he added, referring positively to a far-right anti-Muslim extremist who was banned from traveling to the U.K. due to comments the British government said incite violence.</p><p dir="ltr">“This is not an expression of xenophobia,” Harris insisted. “This is an expression of the implication of statistics and the fact that it’s only rational not to want to live in a world that looks more and more like Jerusalem at the height of the Intifada.”</p><p dir="ltr">Nawaz agreed. “Yes,” he said, “It’s not irrational; it’s not even inhuman, for people to react that way.” He then proceeded to attack “the political left.”</p><p dir="ltr">Nawaz added that this xenophobia is “natural”....It’s a very human response. People like familiarity. People like a sense of predictability around their environment and the culture that they expect others to adhere to.” He claimed “ideologues on the left” are “in denial” about this natural bigotry.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Anti-Muslim double standard</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Harris openly acknowledged in the podcast that he maintains a double standard against Muslims. In an attempt to shield himself from accusations of racism, Harris noted at 1:15:04 that if an Indian family moved next door, he would have no problem; he would in fact welcome them.</p><p dir="ltr">But if these new neighbors were Muslim, Harris said he would be concerned: “What I worry about is bad beliefs.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harris made it clear that his animus against Muslims is exceptional. He went out of his way to claim that there is an “Islamic exceptionalism” — that Islam has uniquely bad “special challenges” other religions do not have. Nawaz said “yeah” in agreement.</p><p dir="ltr">Harris then, at 1:22:55, suggested that Germany could accept migrants from Spain and Portugal to be used as labor, but not from Muslim-majority countries.</p><p dir="ltr">The “fundamental concern” is that “once you get a sufficient percentage of Muslims in any society,” Harris explained at 1:23:09, “the character of that community begins to change.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s just a formula for religious oppression, getting enough Muslims in your society, however they got there originally,” Harris continued. “You can’t have too many Muslims in your culture if you want it to remain enlightened.”</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Attacking antiracists and shieldings extremists</strong></p><p dir="ltr">For holding extreme views like those he expressed on Harris&#039; podcast, the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.splcenter.org/20161025/journalists-manual-field-guide-anti-muslim-extremists">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>, the leading monitor of hate groups in the U.S., has designated Maajid Nawaz an “anti-Muslim extremist.”</p><p dir="ltr">The so-called alt-right — a rebranding of white supremacy and neo-fascism— has viciously attacked the SPLC for documenting its racist machinations. Harris and Nawaz opened the January episode vociferously condemning the SPLC, branding the group as fascist for creating a list of right-wing extremists. Nawaz suggested he would pursue legal action against the group over its criticism of his public statements, and accused the SPLC of defamation.</p><p dir="ltr">In the episode, Harris refused to criticize Robert Spencer (not to be confused with white nationalist Richard Spencer), the Islamophobia industry godfather who also appeared on the SPLC’s anti-Muslim extremist list. Harris noted that Spencer is "unjustly stigmatized," and said he does not want to speak ill of him.</p><p dir="ltr">Robert Spencer is a far-right fanatic who has advanced a number of outlandish conspiracies, including the myth that former president Barack Obama is secretly Muslim. As the SPLC highlighted in its listing, Spencer has condemned multiculturalism as “heresy” that will result in “denigrating and ultimately destroying the Judeo-Christian West.”</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer has glowingly endorsed numerous neo-fascist politicians, including the Netherlands’ Geert Wilders and France’s Jean-Marie Le Pen. He has also recommended the genocidal fantasy novel <em>Camp of the Saints</em>, also a favorite of Donald Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon.</p><p dir="ltr">Amid his calls for fewer Muslims in the West, Sam Harris went out of his way to emphasize to listeners of his podcast that he opposes the term “Islamophobia,” insisting its very existence is mythical. But as usual, his own words contradict him. </p><p dir="ltr"><em>This is Part I of a three-part series on Sam Harris​ and his allies.</em><em> Stay tuned for more this week.</em></p> <!-- iCopyright Interactive Copyright Notice -->

Nancy MacLean reveals the deep and troubling roots of this secretive political establishment -- and its decades-long plan to change the rules of democratic governance -- in her new book, </em>Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America<em>. Get your copy by making a donation to Truthout now!</em></a></p><p>Many individuals who follow politics and journalists think that the right-wing playbook began with the Koch brothers. However, in her groundbreaking book, Nancy MacLean traces their political strategy to a Southern economist who created the foundation for today's libertarian oligarchy in the 1950s.</p><p><strong>Mark Karlin: Can you summarize the importance of James McGill Buchanan to the development of the modern extreme right wing in the United States?</strong></p><p><strong>Nancy MacLean:</strong> The modern extreme right wing I'm talking about, just to be clear, is the libertarian movement that now sails under the Republican flag, particularly but not only the Freedom Caucus, yet goes back to the 1950s in both parties. President Eisenhower called them "stupid" and fashioned his approach -- calling it modern Republicanism -- as an antidote to them. Goldwater was their first presidential candidate. He bombed. Reagan, they believed, was going to enact their agenda. He didn't. But beginning in the early 2000s, they became a force to be reckoned with. What had changed? The discovery by their chief funder, Charles Koch, of the approach developed by James McGill Buchanan for how to take apart the liberal state.</p><p>Buchanan studied economics at the University of Chicago and belonged to the same milieu as F.A. Hayek, Milton Friedman and Ludwig von Mises, but he used his training to analyze public life. And he supplied what no one else had: an operational strategy to vanquish the model of government they had been criticizing for decades -- and prevent it from being recreated. It was Buchanan who taught Koch that for capitalism to thrive, democracy must be enchained.</p><p>Buchanan was a very smart man, the only winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics from the US South, in fact. But his life's work was forever shaped by the Supreme Court's <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> decision. He arrived in Virginia in 1956, just as the state's leaders were goading the white South to fight the court's ruling, a ruling he saw not through the lens of equal protection of the law for all citizens but rather as another wave in a rising tide of unwarranted and illegitimate federal interference in the affairs of the states that began with the New Deal. For him what was at stake was the sanctity of private property rights, with northern liberals telling southern owners how to spend their money and behave correctly. Given an institute to run on the campus of the University of Virginia, he promised to devote his academic career to understanding how the other side became so powerful and, ultimately, to figuring out an effective line of attack to break down what they had created and return to what he and the Virginia elite viewed as appropriate for America. In a nutshell, he studied the workings of the political process to figure out what was needed to deny ordinary people -- white and Black -- the ability to make claims on government at the expense of private property rights and the wishes of capitalists. And then he identified how to rejigger that political process not only to reverse the gains but also to prevent the system from ever reverting back. He sought, in his words, to "enchain Leviathan," which is why I titled the book <em>Democracy in Chains</em>.</p><p><strong>Why, until your book, has his importance to the right wing been largely overlooked?</strong></p><p>There are a few reasons Buchanan has been overlooked. One is that the Koch cause does not advertise his work, preferring to tout the sunnier primers of Hayek, Friedman and even Ayn Rand when recruiting. Buchanan is the advanced course, as it were, for the already committed. Another is that Buchanan did not seek the limelight like Friedman, so few on the left have even heard of him. I myself learned of him only by serendipity, in a footnote about the Virginia schools fight.</p><p>His importance to the right wing could only be identified by working through the archival sources that provide context for his published work. That's what I did after discovering that Buchanan had urged the full privatization of Virginia's public schooling in 1959, and then learning that he later advised the Pinochet regime on a capital-protecting constitution that could withstand the end of the dictatorship. Even with both of those data points, I don't think I could have gleaned the full import of his project had I not moved to North Carolina in 2010, where a strategy informed by his thought has been applied with a vengeance by the veto-proof Republican legislative majority that came to power in the midterms that fall. After Buchanan died in 2013, I was able to get access to his private papers at George Mason University, where the documentation is incontrovertible.</p><p>In fact, Buchanan's records provided a kind of birds-eye view into collaboration between the corporate university and right-wing donors that at least I have never seen before, and I've done a lot of research in this area over the last two decades. </p><p><strong>How would you draw a line connecting Buchanan to the Koch brothers?</strong></p><p>Charles Koch supplied the money, but it was James Buchanan who supplied the ideas that made the money effective. An MIT-trained engineer, Koch in the 1960s began to read political-economic theory based on the notion that free-reign capitalism (what others might call Dickensian capitalism) would justly reward the smart and hardworking and rightly punish those who failed to take responsibility for themselves or had lesser ability. He believed then and believes now that the market is the wisest and fairest form of governance, and one that, after a bitter era of adjustment, will produce untold prosperity, even peace. But after several failures, Koch came to realize that if the majority of Americans ever truly understood the full implications of his vision of the good society and were let in on what was in store for them, they would never support it. Indeed, they would actively oppose it.</p><p>So, Koch went in search of an operational strategy -- what he has called a "technology" -- of revolution that could get around this hurdle. He hunted for 30 years until he found that technology in Buchanan's thought. From Buchanan, Koch learned that for the agenda to succeed, it had to be put in place in incremental steps, what Koch calls "interrelated plays": many distinct yet mutually reinforcing changes of the rules that govern our nation. Koch's team used Buchanan's ideas to devise a roadmap for a radical transformation that could be carried out largely below the radar of the people, yet legally. The plan was (and is) to act on so many ostensibly separate fronts at once that those outside the cause would not realize the revolution underway until it was too late to undo it. Examples include laws to destroy unions without saying that is the true purpose, suppressing the votes of those most likely to support active government, using privatization to alter power relations -- and, to lock it all in, Buchanan's ultimate recommendation: a "constitutional revolution."</p><p>Today, operatives funded by the Koch donor network operate through dozens upon dozens of organizations (hundreds, if you count the state and international groups), creating the impression that they are unconnected when they are really working together -- the state ones are forced to share materials as a condition of their grants. For example, here are the names of 15 of the most important Koch-funded, Buchanan-savvy organizations each with its own assignment in the division of labor: There's Americans for Prosperity, the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the American Legislative Exchange Council, the Mercatus Center, Americans for Tax Reform, Concerned Veterans of America, the Leadership Institute, Generation Opportunity, the Institute for Justice, the Independent Institute, the Club for Growth, the Donors Trust, Freedom Partners, Judicial Watch -- whoops, that's more than 15, and it's not counting the over 60 other organizations in the State Policy Network. This cause operates through so many ostensibly separate organizations that its architects expect the rest of us will ignore all the small but extremely significant changes that cumulatively add up to revolutionary transformation. Gesturing to this, Tyler Cowen, Buchanan's successor at George Mason University, even titled his blog "Marginal Revolution."</p><p><strong>In what way was Buchanan connected to white oligarchical racism?</strong></p><p>Buchanan came up with his approach in the crucible of the civil rights era, as the most oligarchic state elite in the South faced the loss of its accustomed power. Interestingly, he almost never wrote explicitly about racial matters, but he did identify as a proud southern "country boy" and his center gave aid to Virginia's reactionaries on both class and race matters. His heirs at George Mason University, his last home, have noted that Buchanan's political economy is quite like that of John C. Calhoun, the antebellum South Carolina US Senator who, until Buchanan, was America's most original theorist of how to constrict democracy so as to safeguard the wealth and power of an elite economic minority (in Calhoun's case, large slaveholders). Buchanan arrived in Virginia just as Calhoun's ideas were being excavated to stop the implementation of <em>Brown</em>, so the kinship was more than a coincidence. His vision of the right economic constitution owes much to Calhoun, whose ideas horrified James Madison, among others.</p><p>And from that kind of thought, Buchanan offered strategic advice to corporations on how to fight the kind of reforms and taxation that came with more inclusive democracy. In the 1990s, for example, as Koch was getting more involved at George Mason, Buchanan convened corporate and rightwing leaders to teach them how to use what he called the "spectrum of secession" to undercut hard-won reforms through measures that have now become core to Republican practice: decentralization, devolution, federalism, privatization, and deregulation. We tend to see the race to the bottom as fallout from globalization, but Buchanan's guidance and the Koch team's application of it through the American Legislative Exchange Council and the State Policy Network reveals how it is in fact a highly conscious strategy to free capital of restraint by the people through their governments.</p><p>Another way all this connects, indirectly, to oligarchic racism: wanting to keep secessionist thought alive for this practical utility, the billionaire-backed right necessarily gives comfort to white supremacists. A case in point: the Virginia governors who supported the Buchanan-Koch enterprise at George Mason University also promoted a new "Confederate History and Heritage Month." Likewise, the Ludwig von Mises Institute, which honors one of Koch's favorite Austrian philosophers, is located in Alabama and led by Llewellyn Rockwell, Jr., a man who has long promoted racist neo-Confederate thought, yet was still thought fit to run the Koch-funded Center for Libertarian Studies. It's thus a mistake to imagine that the Koch and so-called alt-right causes are wholly separate; there's a kind of mutual reinforcement if you understand what Koch learned from Buchanan and how they operated.</p><p>As I conclude in the book, as bright as some of the libertarian economists were, their ideas gained the following they did in the South because, in their essence, their stands were so familiar. White southerners who opposed racial equality and economic justice knew from their own region's long history that the only way they could protect their desired way of life was to keep federal power at bay, so that majoritarian democracy could not reach into the region. The causes of Calhoun, Buchanan and Koch-style economic liberty and white supremacy were historically twined at the roots, which makes them very hard to separate, regardless of the subjective intentions of today's libertarians.</p><p><strong>What would a society based on Buchanan's principles and goals look like?</strong></p><p>Tyler Cowen, the economist who co-presides with Charles Koch over the cause's academic base camp (yes, that Tyler Cowen, host of the most visited academic economics blog), has spelled that out. You might want to sit down to hear what he envisions for the rest of us. He has written that with the "rewriting of the social contract" underway, people will be "expected to fend for themselves much more than they do now." While some will flourish, he admits, "others will fall by the wayside." Since "worthy individuals" will manage to climb their way out of poverty, "that will make it easier to ignore those who are left behind." And Cowen didn't stop there. "We will cut Medicaid for the poor," he predicted. Further, "the fiscal shortfall will come out of real wages as various cost burdens are shifted to workers" from employers and a government that does less. To "compensate," this chaired professor in the nation's second-wealthiest county advises, "people who have had their government benefits cut or pared back" should pack up and move to lower-cost, poor public service states like Texas.</p><p>Indeed, Cowen forecasts, "the United States as a whole will end up looking more like Texas." His tone is matter-of-fact, as though he is reporting the inevitable. Yet when one reads his remarks with the knowledge that he has been the academic leader of a team working in earnest with Koch for two decades now to bring about the society he is describing, the words sound more like premeditation. For example, Cowen prophesies lower-income parts of America "recreating a Mexico-like or Brazil-like environment" complete with "favelas" like those in Rio de Janeiro. The "quality of water" might not be what US citizens are used to, he admits, but "partial shantytowns" would satisfy the need for cheaper housing as "wage polarization" grows and government shrinks. Cowen says that "some version of Texas -- and then some -- is the future for a lot of us" and advises, "Get ready."</p><p><strong>You conclude your book ironically with a Koch maxim: "playing it safe is slow suicide." How does that apply to those who support a robust, non-plutocratic society?</strong></p><p>I ended the book that way because I understand the many pressures that lead people not to act on their anxiety over what they are seeing unfold in Washington and so many states. Union leaders have fiduciary responsibilities that make bold action risky. Nonprofits have boards of directors to answer to. Young faculty must earn tenure. People in public institutions worry about their next appropriations. Parents have to budget their time. And so on. We tell ourselves, "Well, if it were that serious, surely others would be doing something about it." So, I wanted to alert people that what is happening now is radically new -- and designed to be permanent. We may not get another chance to stop it.</p><p>Having said that, though, I also believe that panic is the last thing we need. There is great strength to be found in the simple truth that Buchanan and Koch came up with the kind of strategy now in play precisely because they knew that the majority, if fully informed, would never support what they seek. So, the best thing that those who support a robust, non-plutocratic society can do is focus on patiently informing and activating that majority. And reminding all Americans that democracy is not something you can just assume will survive: It has to be fought for time and again. This is one of those moments.</p><p>Copyright, <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/41206-misinforming-the-majority-a-deliberate-strategy-of-right-wing-libertarians">Truthou</a>t.

Nancy MacLean reveals the deep and troubling roots of this secretive political establishment -- and its decades-long plan to change the rules of democratic governance -- in her new book, </em>Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right&#039;s Stealth Plan for America<em>. Get your copy by making a donation to Truthout now!</em></a></p><p>Many individuals who follow politics and journalists think that the right-wing playbook began with the Koch brothers. However, in her groundbreaking book, Nancy MacLean traces their political strategy to a Southern economist who created the foundation for today&#039;s libertarian oligarchy in the 1950s.</p><p><strong>Mark Karlin: Can you summarize the importance of James McGill Buchanan to the development of the modern extreme right wing in the United States?</strong></p><p><strong>Nancy MacLean:</strong> The modern extreme right wing I&#039;m talking about, just to be clear, is the libertarian movement that now sails under the Republican flag, particularly but not only the Freedom Caucus, yet goes back to the 1950s in both parties. President Eisenhower called them "stupid" and fashioned his approach -- calling it modern Republicanism -- as an antidote to them. Goldwater was their first presidential candidate. He bombed. Reagan, they believed, was going to enact their agenda. He didn&#039;t. But beginning in the early 2000s, they became a force to be reckoned with. What had changed? The discovery by their chief funder, Charles Koch, of the approach developed by James McGill Buchanan for how to take apart the liberal state.</p><p>Buchanan studied economics at the University of Chicago and belonged to the same milieu as F.A. Hayek, Milton Friedman and Ludwig von Mises, but he used his training to analyze public life. And he supplied what no one else had: an operational strategy to vanquish the model of government they had been criticizing for decades -- and prevent it from being recreated. It was Buchanan who taught Koch that for capitalism to thrive, democracy must be enchained.</p><p>Buchanan was a very smart man, the only winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics from the US South, in fact. But his life&#039;s work was forever shaped by the Supreme Court&#039;s <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> decision. He arrived in Virginia in 1956, just as the state&#039;s leaders were goading the white South to fight the court&#039;s ruling, a ruling he saw not through the lens of equal protection of the law for all citizens but rather as another wave in a rising tide of unwarranted and illegitimate federal interference in the affairs of the states that began with the New Deal. For him what was at stake was the sanctity of private property rights, with northern liberals telling southern owners how to spend their money and behave correctly. Given an institute to run on the campus of the University of Virginia, he promised to devote his academic career to understanding how the other side became so powerful and, ultimately, to figuring out an effective line of attack to break down what they had created and return to what he and the Virginia elite viewed as appropriate for America. In a nutshell, he studied the workings of the political process to figure out what was needed to deny ordinary people -- white and Black -- the ability to make claims on government at the expense of private property rights and the wishes of capitalists. And then he identified how to rejigger that political process not only to reverse the gains but also to prevent the system from ever reverting back. He sought, in his words, to "enchain Leviathan," which is why I titled the book <em>Democracy in Chains</em>.</p><p><strong>Why, until your book, has his importance to the right wing been largely overlooked?</strong></p><p>There are a few reasons Buchanan has been overlooked. One is that the Koch cause does not advertise his work, preferring to tout the sunnier primers of Hayek, Friedman and even Ayn Rand when recruiting. Buchanan is the advanced course, as it were, for the already committed. Another is that Buchanan did not seek the limelight like Friedman, so few on the left have even heard of him. I myself learned of him only by serendipity, in a footnote about the Virginia schools fight.</p><p>His importance to the right wing could only be identified by working through the archival sources that provide context for his published work. That&#039;s what I did after discovering that Buchanan had urged the full privatization of Virginia&#039;s public schooling in 1959, and then learning that he later advised the Pinochet regime on a capital-protecting constitution that could withstand the end of the dictatorship. Even with both of those data points, I don&#039;t think I could have gleaned the full import of his project had I not moved to North Carolina in 2010, where a strategy informed by his thought has been applied with a vengeance by the veto-proof Republican legislative majority that came to power in the midterms that fall. After Buchanan died in 2013, I was able to get access to his private papers at George Mason University, where the documentation is incontrovertible.</p><p>In fact, Buchanan&#039;s records provided a kind of birds-eye view into collaboration between the corporate university and right-wing donors that at least I have never seen before, and I&#039;ve done a lot of research in this area over the last two decades. </p><p><strong>How would you draw a line connecting Buchanan to the Koch brothers?</strong></p><p>Charles Koch supplied the money, but it was James Buchanan who supplied the ideas that made the money effective. An MIT-trained engineer, Koch in the 1960s began to read political-economic theory based on the notion that free-reign capitalism (what others might call Dickensian capitalism) would justly reward the smart and hardworking and rightly punish those who failed to take responsibility for themselves or had lesser ability. He believed then and believes now that the market is the wisest and fairest form of governance, and one that, after a bitter era of adjustment, will produce untold prosperity, even peace. But after several failures, Koch came to realize that if the majority of Americans ever truly understood the full implications of his vision of the good society and were let in on what was in store for them, they would never support it. Indeed, they would actively oppose it.</p><p>So, Koch went in search of an operational strategy -- what he has called a "technology" -- of revolution that could get around this hurdle. He hunted for 30 years until he found that technology in Buchanan&#039;s thought. From Buchanan, Koch learned that for the agenda to succeed, it had to be put in place in incremental steps, what Koch calls "interrelated plays": many distinct yet mutually reinforcing changes of the rules that govern our nation. Koch&#039;s team used Buchanan&#039;s ideas to devise a roadmap for a radical transformation that could be carried out largely below the radar of the people, yet legally. The plan was (and is) to act on so many ostensibly separate fronts at once that those outside the cause would not realize the revolution underway until it was too late to undo it. Examples include laws to destroy unions without saying that is the true purpose, suppressing the votes of those most likely to support active government, using privatization to alter power relations -- and, to lock it all in, Buchanan&#039;s ultimate recommendation: a "constitutional revolution."</p><p>Today, operatives funded by the Koch donor network operate through dozens upon dozens of organizations (hundreds, if you count the state and international groups), creating the impression that they are unconnected when they are really working together -- the state ones are forced to share materials as a condition of their grants. For example, here are the names of 15 of the most important Koch-funded, Buchanan-savvy organizations each with its own assignment in the division of labor: There&#039;s Americans for Prosperity, the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the American Legislative Exchange Council, the Mercatus Center, Americans for Tax Reform, Concerned Veterans of America, the Leadership Institute, Generation Opportunity, the Institute for Justice, the Independent Institute, the Club for Growth, the Donors Trust, Freedom Partners, Judicial Watch -- whoops, that&#039;s more than 15, and it&#039;s not counting the over 60 other organizations in the State Policy Network.

In 1993, Futerfas represented a member of the infamous Genovese crime family, <a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/townnews/law/mobsters-convicted-in-moves-on-atlantic-city/article_17c7a9ee-1c61-11e6-8a74-3b8f5415461d.html" target="_blank">Salvatore “Sally Dogs” Lombardi</a> from Staten Island. Lombardi and a number of other defendants from the family were facing trial for attempting to illegally expand gambling operations into Atlantic City. A jury ultimately found Lombardi guilty of racketeering, extortion and illegal gambling.</p><p>Again in 1998, Futerfas was the defense attorney for <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/court-ruling-lets-93-mob-murder-raps-stand-article-1.787521" target="_blank">Anthony Russo</a>, who was convicted of murder and racketeering charges along with two other mobsters for involvement in the crime family’s street war. The constant violence in 1991 and 1992 caused by the crime family led to 11 deaths. In 1998, the three mobsters were denied a new trial after being found guilty in 1993.</p><p>Futerfas also represented Anthony's son, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/24/nyregion/attempted-murder-charge-is-added-in-a-beating-case.html" target="_blank">Alfonse Russo</a>, in a case where he and two other white teenagers beat a black man in Brooklyn in 1997 in a racially motivated attack. According to the New York Times, Alfonse had beat the victim with the bar of a steering wheel. Alfonse and the two teenagers were later <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/10/nyregion/3-convicted-in-racial-beating-in-brooklyn.html" target="_blank">convicted</a> of second-degreee assault and second-degree aggravated harassment, but escaped the more serious charge of attempted murder.</p><p>In 2012, Futerfas was the defense attorney 35-year-old <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/rising-stars-gambino-crime-family-shipped-prison-article-1.1087040" target="_blank">Michael “Roc” Roccaforte</a>, a mobster who was part of the group of 27 arrested by police in the Southern District of Manhattan. Roccaforte had pleaded guilty to breaking a multitude of laws in the past decade, including racketeering, selling drugs, gambling and loan sharking. He received a 118-month sentence for his crimes, a sentence four months harsher than what federal prosecutors aimed for. Futerfas unsuccessfully tried arguing for the minimum-possible 97-month sentence for Roccaforte.</p> <!-- iCopyright Interactive Copyright Notice -->

And yet, <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/congress-trump-russia-poll-628682" target="_blank" title="64 percent of Americans">64 percent of Americans</a> think that the RussiaGate investigations are hurting the country, and a majority wants Congress to focus on other issues, like the economy.</p><p>These polls tell you what you already know: The country is deeply divided, the Democrats haven’t been able to come up with a convincing way of bridging the divide, and the RussiaGate investigations are no substitute for a political platform.</p><p>It’s a long way until the mid-term elections in November 2018 and the RussiaGate investigation is still in its infancy, but already the Democratic Party is in the midst of a second round of soul-searching about its strategy.</p><p>The first round took place after Donald Trump swept to a narrow Electoral College victory last November and largely hinged on whether the Sanders focus on economic inequality would have done better at the polls against Trump than Hillary Clinton’s more cautious centrism. This second round continues the debate on this question, but also throws in the wild cards of Russia and Trump’s potential wrongdoing.</p><p>Shortly after Democrat Jon Ossoff lost a close race in Georgia this month, Democrats began to speak up about the electoral implications of RussiaGate. <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/339248-dems-push-leaders-to-talk-less-about-russia" target="_blank" title="Reports The Hill">Reports <em>The Hill</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>In the wake of a string of special-election defeats, an increasing number of Democrats are calling for an adjustment in party messaging, one that swings the focus from Russia to the economy. The outcome of the 2018 elections, they say, hinges on how well the Democrats manage that shift. </em></p><p><em>“We can’t just talk about Russia because people back in Ohio aren’t really talking that much about Russia, about Putin, about Michael Flynn,” Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) told MSNBC Thursday. “They’re trying to figure out how they’re going to make the mortgage payment, how they’re going to pay for their kids to go to college, what their energy bill looks like.”</em></p></blockquote><p>At one level, this same debate recurs every election cycle — do people care more about foreign policy questions or pocketbook issues? The answer is almost always: the economy. At another level, the debate is about whether Trump’s unpopularity can be used against him. It’s another enduring debate: take advantage of the incumbent’s negatives or field a positive alternative? As the 2004 and 2012 election results suggest, the opposition has to offer something intrinsically appealing or risk defeat.</p><p>The four recent by-elections don’t provide much to go on in terms of any serious reevaluation of strategy. They all took place in Republican-friendly areas that have yet to feel any real impact from Trump administration policies. Ossoff, in particular, did much better than his district’s partisan preferences should have dictated (<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-georgia-election-ossoff-loss-handel-20170621-story.html" target="_blank" title="6 percent better">6 percent better</a>, according to the Cook Political Report). Nor did Ossoff spend a lot of time focused on Russia. He was no Sanderista, but he didn’t make Donald Trump and his transgressions a central part of his campaign. It’s hard to come to any definitive conclusions from this race or the other three.</p><p>Still, the by-elections have stimulated an important discussion. Where one comes down on the Russia vs. jobs question depends in large part on on how one assesses the reasons for Trump’s victory and whether RussiaGate can or should function as a club to beat back the Republicans in future elections.</p><p>This debate is not just about electoral strategy. It’s also about how the United States should address the current global crisis of liberalism.</p><p><strong>Interpreting Trump’s Victory</strong></p><p>There are two ways of understanding how Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election: the triple backlash versus the triple hack.</p><p>According to the <a href="http://fpif.org/trump-transformation-politics/" title="triple backlash argument">triple backlash argument</a>, Trump benefited from a worldwide rejection of liberalism: economically, politically, and culturally. Large sections of the United States that didn’t benefit from economic globalization watched the disappearance of well-paying jobs from the Rust Belt, rural areas and small towns, and certain big cities.</p><p>These residents of <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176157/tomgram%3A_john_feffer%2C_donald_trump_and_america_b/" target="_blank" title="America B">America B</a> blamed politicians from both parties for pushing economic reforms that shifted wealth upward and out of their communities. And they also blamed a range of “others” for what was wrong with the country: immigrants, people of color, social liberals. This economic-political-cultural backlash prepared the ground for a political outsider with an anti-immigrant agenda and a promise to revive America’s sunset industries.</p><p>The triple hack argument is much more focused. Trump “hacked” the system in three important ways, exploiting vulnerabilities to gain his narrow win.</p><p>The first hack was of the Electoral College. Trump didn’t care about the popular vote. He knew that he could write off large swathes of the American electorate and concentrate his forces in a few swing states. So, for instance, the campaign <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/donald-trump-campaign-virginia/index.html" target="_blank" title="pulled resources">pulled resources</a> out of Virginia, an otherwise important state for Republicans to win, to focus on the Midwest.</p><p>The second hack was the news media. The Trump campaign exploited the mainstream media’s fascination with the outrageous by constantly feeding it new outrages. It also generated a spate of “fake news” about Hillary Clinton that it distributed on the margins, in places like Breitbart News and through social media like Facebook and Trump’s own Twitter account. Here, Russian journalists and trolls played a role, though probably not a pivotal one.</p><p>Finally, the campaign hacked Facebook in two critical ways. It poured money into an advertising campaign tailored to the preferences of over 200 million Americans contained in three separate databases to which the campaign <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/06/08/how-trump-used-facebook-to-win/" target="_blank" title="maintained access">maintained access</a>. And it created a “dark posts” campaign to dissuade three groups of potential Democratic voters — Sanders supporters, young women, and African Americans in urban areas — from going to the polls.</p><p>On top of the official <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/2016-a-case-study-in-voter-suppression-258b5f90ddcd" target="_blank" title="voter suppression efforts">voter suppression efforts</a> run by the Republican Party — reducing early voting, implementing onerous voter ID laws — this “keep out the vote” campaign was remarkably effective. In Detroit, a Democratic stronghold, Clinton <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/opinion/what-i-got-wrong-about-the-election.html" target="_blank" title="received 70,000 fewer votes">received 70,000 fewer votes</a> than Obama got in his last outing. She lost the state of Michigan by fewer than 11,000 votes.</p><p>If you believe in the triple backlash argument, you’re more inclined to push for a political program that focuses on economic inequality and job creation, particularly in depressed parts of the country. If you lean more toward the triple hack argument, you’re more likely to focus on counter-hack tactics — a better media strategy, a better way of getting out the vote, a better way of using oppositional research to undermine the opponent (even to the point of impeachment).</p><p>Because the debate over the triple backlash opens up rifts within the party, the Democrats will likely focus on technical “fixes” to recapture Congress in 2018 and regain the 80,000 votes that Clinton lost by in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania in order to win the presidency in 2020. Such an approach would be wise tactically. But it would be disastrous in the long term.</p><p><strong>Responding to RussiaGate</strong></p><p>The investigation into Russian meddling in the American election has inevitably acquired a partisan taint. The Democrats have used it to question the legitimacy of the election and of the Trump administration more generally. Trump and the Republicans have accused their detractors of conducting a witch-hunt.</p><p>It may come out in the investigation that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. It may also come out that Trump, as president, obstructed justice by firing Comey and covering up elements of collaboration. RussiaGate might bring down Donald Trump and some of his advisers. Or it might turn out to be a series of murky, unprovable assertions.</p><p>Regardless of the Trump team’s actual involvement in the scandal, Russia tampered with the U.S. political system. Russian hackers acquired information from both major parties but decided only to weaponize the material from the Democrats to compromise its chances in the election. Hackers <a href="http://time.com/4828306/russian-hacking-election-widespread-private-data/" target="_blank" title="tried to break into">tried to break into</a> 21 state electoral systems, stole nearly 90,000 voter records, and even altered voter information in at least one case.

RussiaGate isn’t just a threat to the Democratic Party. It’s a threat to democratic politics — everywhere. And it requires not just a bipartisan response. It requires a transatlantic response.</p><p><strong>Responding to the Crisis of Liberalism</strong></p><p>Donald Trump has an answer for the crisis of liberalism and the triple backlash that produced his electoral victory.</p><p>He’s challenged the existing global economy by pulling the United States out of the Trans Pacific Partnership and has promised to tear up — or significantly renegotiate — a number of other trade deals. He’s challenged the liberal administrative state by attempting to gut social welfare and the government regulatory apparatus across the board. He’s challenged liberal norms of inclusion with his travel ban, an anti-immigrant crusade, and other policies that will adversely affect women, people of color, and the LGBT community.</p><p>Vladimir Putin also has an answer for the crisis of liberalism that brought Russia to its knees in the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse. He believes — at least instrumentally — in the three Cs: Christianity, conservativism, and Caucasians. He wants to create a reactionary, religious, and racist axis that unifies the Global North. But this is not about international cooperation. Putin thinks only in terms of Russian interests, which actually boil down to the economic interests of the oligarchs aligned with his regime.</p><p>Employing “elves” to battle Russian trolls isn’t enough. Creating commissions to track and neutralize cyberattacks is not enough. Piling revelation upon revelation about RussiaGate is not enough. These tactics are necessary but not sufficient.</p><p>Instead of talking back to the TV, we should change the channel. Progressives need to come up with our own answer to the crisis of liberalism. We can borrow from progressive economic ideas of the past (government work programs, for example, to create jobs). We can borrow from populist political tactics (which worked so well for Bernie Sanders, for example). We can even borrow from liberalism itself (the notion of an open, inclusive society). But we must also come up with bold new programs around renewable energy, the revival of community, and international cooperation.</p><p>Russia versus jobs is in some ways a false dichotomy. Progressives have to devise a comprehensive alternative that responds to both the challenge of Russia and the failures of liberalism. If we don’t, we’ll not only lose the mid-terms and the next presidential election in the United States. We’ll lose the planet.</p> &nbsp;<h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/evidence-trump-administrations-collusion-russia-piling-fast">Evidence of the Trump Administration&#039;s Collusion with Russia is Piling Up Fast</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/watch-video-confirms-mike-pence-deep-deep-trouble">WATCH: The Video That Confirms Mike Pence Is in Deep, Deep Trouble</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/trump-putin-meeting-and-fate-earth">The Trump-Putin Meeting and the Fate of the Earth</a></li></ul>

This second round continues the debate on this question, but also throws in the wild cards of Russia and Trump’s potential wrongdoing.</p><p>Shortly after Democrat Jon Ossoff lost a close race in Georgia this month, Democrats began to speak up about the electoral implications of RussiaGate. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~thehill.com/homenews/campaign/339248-dems-push-leaders-to-talk-less-about-russia" target="_blank" title="Reports The Hill">Reports <em>The Hill</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>In the wake of a string of special-election defeats, an increasing number of Democrats are calling for an adjustment in party messaging, one that swings the focus from Russia to the economy. The outcome of the 2018 elections, they say, hinges on how well the Democrats manage that shift. </em></p><p><em>“We can’t just talk about Russia because people back in Ohio aren’t really talking that much about Russia, about Putin, about Michael Flynn,” Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) told MSNBC Thursday. “They’re trying to figure out how they’re going to make the mortgage payment, how they’re going to pay for their kids to go to college, what their energy bill looks like.”</em></p></blockquote><p>At one level, this same debate recurs every election cycle — do people care more about foreign policy questions or pocketbook issues? The answer is almost always: the economy. At another level, the debate is about whether Trump’s unpopularity can be used against him. It’s another enduring debate: take advantage of the incumbent’s negatives or field a positive alternative? As the 2004 and 2012 election results suggest, the opposition has to offer something intrinsically appealing or risk defeat.</p><p>The four recent by-elections don’t provide much to go on in terms of any serious reevaluation of strategy. They all took place in Republican-friendly areas that have yet to feel any real impact from Trump administration policies. Ossoff, in particular, did much better than his district’s partisan preferences should have dictated (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-georgia-election-ossoff-loss-handel-20170621-story.html" target="_blank" title="6 percent better">6 percent better</a>, according to the Cook Political Report). Nor did Ossoff spend a lot of time focused on Russia. He was no Sanderista, but he didn’t make Donald Trump and his transgressions a central part of his campaign. It’s hard to come to any definitive conclusions from this race or the other three.</p><p>Still, the by-elections have stimulated an important discussion. Where one comes down on the Russia vs. jobs question depends in large part on on how one assesses the reasons for Trump’s victory and whether RussiaGate can or should function as a club to beat back the Republicans in future elections.</p><p>This debate is not just about electoral strategy. It’s also about how the United States should address the current global crisis of liberalism.</p><p><strong>Interpreting Trump’s Victory</strong></p><p>There are two ways of understanding how Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election: the triple backlash versus the triple hack.</p><p>According to the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~fpif.org/trump-transformation-politics/" title="triple backlash argument">triple backlash argument</a>, Trump benefited from a worldwide rejection of liberalism: economically, politically, and culturally. Large sections of the United States that didn’t benefit from economic globalization watched the disappearance of well-paying jobs from the Rust Belt, rural areas and small towns, and certain big cities.</p><p>These residents of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176157/tomgram%3A_john_feffer%2C_donald_trump_and_america_b/" target="_blank" title="America B">America B</a> blamed politicians from both parties for pushing economic reforms that shifted wealth upward and out of their communities. And they also blamed a range of “others” for what was wrong with the country: immigrants, people of color, social liberals. This economic-political-cultural backlash prepared the ground for a political outsider with an anti-immigrant agenda and a promise to revive America’s sunset industries.</p><p>The triple hack argument is much more focused. Trump “hacked” the system in three important ways, exploiting vulnerabilities to gain his narrow win.</p><p>The first hack was of the Electoral College. Trump didn’t care about the popular vote. He knew that he could write off large swathes of the American electorate and concentrate his forces in a few swing states. So, for instance, the campaign <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.cnn.com/2016/10/13/politics/donald-trump-campaign-virginia/index.html" target="_blank" title="pulled resources">pulled resources</a> out of Virginia, an otherwise important state for Republicans to win, to focus on the Midwest.</p><p>The second hack was the news media. The Trump campaign exploited the mainstream media’s fascination with the outrageous by constantly feeding it new outrages. It also generated a spate of “fake news” about Hillary Clinton that it distributed on the margins, in places like Breitbart News and through social media like Facebook and Trump’s own Twitter account. Here, Russian journalists and trolls played a role, though probably not a pivotal one.</p><p>Finally, the campaign hacked Facebook in two critical ways. It poured money into an advertising campaign tailored to the preferences of over 200 million Americans contained in three separate databases to which the campaign <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/06/08/how-trump-used-facebook-to-win/" target="_blank" title="maintained access">maintained access</a>. And it created a “dark posts” campaign to dissuade three groups of potential Democratic voters — Sanders supporters, young women, and African Americans in urban areas — from going to the polls.</p><p>On top of the official <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://thinkprogress.org/2016-a-case-study-in-voter-suppression-258b5f90ddcd" target="_blank" title="voter suppression efforts">voter suppression efforts</a> run by the Republican Party — reducing early voting, implementing onerous voter ID laws — this “keep out the vote” campaign was remarkably effective. In Detroit, a Democratic stronghold, Clinton <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/opinion/what-i-got-wrong-about-the-election.html" target="_blank" title="received 70,000 fewer votes">received 70,000 fewer votes</a> than Obama got in his last outing. She lost the state of Michigan by fewer than 11,000 votes.</p><p>If you believe in the triple backlash argument, you’re more inclined to push for a political program that focuses on economic inequality and job creation, particularly in depressed parts of the country. If you lean more toward the triple hack argument, you’re more likely to focus on counter-hack tactics — a better media strategy, a better way of getting out the vote, a better way of using oppositional research to undermine the opponent (even to the point of impeachment).</p><p>Because the debate over the triple backlash opens up rifts within the party, the Democrats will likely focus on technical “fixes” to recapture Congress in 2018 and regain the 80,000 votes that Clinton lost by in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania in order to win the presidency in 2020. Such an approach would be wise tactically. But it would be disastrous in the long term.</p><p><strong>Responding to RussiaGate</strong></p><p>The investigation into Russian meddling in the American election has inevitably acquired a partisan taint. The Democrats have used it to question the legitimacy of the election and of the Trump administration more generally. Trump and the Republicans have accused their detractors of conducting a witch-hunt.</p><p>It may come out in the investigation that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. It may also come out that Trump, as president, obstructed justice by firing Comey and covering up elements of collaboration. RussiaGate might bring down Donald Trump and some of his advisers. Or it might turn out to be a series of murky, unprovable assertions.</p><p>Regardless of the Trump team’s actual involvement in the scandal, Russia tampered with the U.S. political system. Russian hackers acquired information from both major parties but decided only to weaponize the material from the Democrats to compromise its chances in the election.

These tactics are necessary but not sufficient.</p><p>Instead of talking back to the TV, we should change the channel. Progressives need to come up with our own answer to the crisis of liberalism. We can borrow from progressive economic ideas of the past (government work programs, for example, to create jobs). We can borrow from populist political tactics (which worked so well for Bernie Sanders, for example). We can even borrow from liberalism itself (the notion of an open, inclusive society). But we must also come up with bold new programs around renewable energy, the revival of community, and international cooperation.</p><p>Russia versus jobs is in some ways a false dichotomy. Progressives have to devise a comprehensive alternative that responds to both the challenge of Russia and the failures of liberalism. If we don’t, we’ll not only lose the mid-terms and the next presidential election in the United States. We’ll lose the planet.</p> <Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" alt="" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/393285196/0/alternet">

The governments of China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran, India, and Mexico also own entities, which make the top ten list. </p><p class="p1">The study, which also shows that 100 companies are responsible for over 70 percent of global emissions, highlights the critical role of corporations and powerful state actors not only perpetuating environmental damage, but also in combatting climate change.</p><p class="p1">If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next 20 years, the world could see a 4°C rise in global temperatures by the end of the century, leading to mass extinctions and widespread starvation.</p><p class="p1">Here are the top ten corporate and state-entity polluters: </p><p class="p1"><strong>1. China (Coal): 14.3 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">China's state-led coal production has tripled to almost 4 billion tons since 2000, contributing to around half of all global emissions. </p><p class="p1"><strong>2. Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Aramco): 4.5 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">Saudi Arabia's state-owned Aramco has the world's largest crude oil reserves and the highest daily production output of any company in the world. </p><p class="p1"><strong>3. Gazprom OAO (Russian): 3.9 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">Russian-owned <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/qa-gazprom-and-the-arctic/">Gazprom OAO</a> has been the target of environmental protests for its Arctic drilling. </p><p class="p1"><strong>4. National Iranian Oil Co: 2.3 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">Iran's state-owned natural gas company has had unilateral control over the country's oil reserves since 1948. </p><p class="p1"><strong>5. ExxonMobil Corp: 2.0 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">ExxonMobil is the world's seventh largest corporation, an offspring of John D. Rockerfeller's Standard Oil Company. ExxonMobil has <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article120614433.html">lobbied</a> against climate change action in the U.S. Congress.</p><p class="p1"><strong>6. Coal India: 1.9 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">State-owned Coal India is the largest producer of coal in the world. </p><p class="p1"><strong>7. Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex): 1.9 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">In 2009, Mexican state-owned Pemex was Latin America's <a href="http://rankings.americaeconomia.com/2010/500/ranking-500-america-latina.php">second largest corporation</a>. </p><p class="p1"><strong>8. Russia (Coal): 1.9 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">Russia saw a 70-percent increase in coal production since the late 1990s. </p><p class="p1"><strong>9. Royal Dutch Shell PLC (Shell): 1.7 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">Shell is the seventh largest corporation in the world, and involved in every area of the coal and gas production chain.

The governments of China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran, India, and Mexico also own entities, which make the top ten list. </p><p class="p1">The study, which also shows that 100 companies are responsible for over 70 percent of global emissions, highlights the critical role of corporations and powerful state actors not only perpetuating environmental damage, but also in combatting climate change.</p><p class="p1">If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate over the next 20 years, the world could see a 4°C rise in global temperatures by the end of the century, leading to mass extinctions and widespread starvation.</p><p class="p1">Here are the top ten corporate and state-entity polluters: </p><p class="p1"><strong>1.

Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Aramco): 4.5 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">Saudi Arabia&#039;s state-owned Aramco has the world&#039;s largest crude oil reserves and the highest daily production output of any company in the world. </p><p class="p1"><strong>3. Gazprom OAO (Russian): 3.9 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">Russian-owned <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.greenpeace.org/usa/qa-gazprom-and-the-arctic/">Gazprom OAO</a> has been the target of environmental protests for its Arctic drilling. </p><p class="p1"><strong>4. National Iranian Oil Co: 2.3 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">Iran&#039;s state-owned natural gas company has had unilateral control over the country&#039;s oil reserves since 1948. </p><p class="p1"><strong>5. ExxonMobil Corp: 2.0 percent</strong></p><p class="p1">ExxonMobil is the world&#039;s seventh largest corporation, an offspring of John D. Rockerfeller&#039;s Standard Oil Company.

<!--smart_paging_autop_filter--> <p>John was fresh-out-of-college and had never set foot in a city school before. Hired the day before the school year started, he missed out on the two-and-a-half weeks of training the charter organization had given the rest of us on what to expect at a turnaround school in Camden, NJ. John lasted less than a week.</p><p>I’d started the year as a history teacher, relieved to be without the responsibility of my own classroom and homeroom. But after five more teachers followed John out of the school building within the first month, I had both. When I left at the beginning of the next school year, seven more teachers were right behind me.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Turmoil and churn as a strategy</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When a school loses teachers, by choice or by chance, students are cheated out of continuity, while the goals and objectives of the entire organization can be hindered. In charter schools, including the ones where I taught for six years, this problem is particularly pronounced. Teachers <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/turnover-charter-school-plague-article-1.3272954">leave charters</a> at significantly higher rates when compared to traditional public schools. Among urban charter schools, it’s not uncommon to see teachers turning over at a rate of 30, 40 or even 50% a year. I’ve witnessed first hand—and experienced—why this is such a problem, and what causes teachers to flee. But I’ve also seen for myself that there are charter schools and networks that don’t mind high levels of teacher turnover. Turmoil and churn work for organizations that are determined to control both the makeup and the mindset of their faculty.</p><p dir="ltr">To understand why teachers leave charter schools, you have to first look at what their teaching lives are like. When they start out, they work ten to twelve hours and day, then two more hours when they get home. Young and/or inexperienced in the classroom, they believe that they can save the world one child at a time. They drink the proverbial Kool-Aid offered to them by their charter organization. Whatever salary is offered, they accept, knowing that the extra work they do isn’t compensated. But life happens. Those once green teachers grow older, gaining skills, savvy and experience. They seek career advancement opportunities, better pay and a seat at the table. And major life changes—they get married, have kids of their own—demand more time for life outside of school. Some teachers get tired of putting in extra hours every day. Wearing “extra hats” starts to wear thin. They burn out from turbulent working conditions in concert with real issues beyond the appeal of caring adults. The appeal of working for an organization that demands time, labor and allegiance to the mission first (too often raising test scores), and the children second, begins to fade.</p><p dir="ltr">And so these teachers walk away, just in time to be replaced by a new crop of the young, idealistic teachers they once were. Charter school fans often <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/high-teacher-turnover-charter-schools-matter-article-1.3281888">point to</a> teacher turnover as a net positive. Unlike traditional public schools with their union contracts, charters are flushing out the teachers who can’t hack it, and as long as the test scores are going up, who cares how long the teachers stay? But this weeding out process is designed to rid schools of more than just the incompetents. It’s also a way of eliminating teachers who no longer see eye to eye with the organization. As teachers become more confident, in their teaching and in themselves, they start to speak out against what’s wrong—sometimes at the expense of their employment.</p><p dir="ltr">I am not implying that it is the goal of charter schools to intentionally facilitate a mass exodus of teachers at the end of every school year. Yet I heard for myself charter school leaders say that they appreciate how the challenges of urban of education enable them to maintain just the right roster of faculty. At times these leaders expedited the weeding process by subjecting particular teachers to micromanagement and redundant observations. I also witnessed leaders lean on skilled and talented teachers, and teachers of color, requesting that they carry a bit more of the emotional and administrative workload, to "test" whether or not they could meet the demands of the organization.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Weeding out teachers to maintain control</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The weeding process is all about maintaining control where there is none. It serves to remove "troublemakers": the folks who will hold the organization accountable. For charter leadership looking to maintain sovereignty of mission and mission implementation, teachers who are independent thinkers and teachers with lives outside of schools are as much of a detriment as those deemed incompetent. The teachers who remain either like the Kool-Aid or at the very least are still thirsty.</p><p dir="ltr">Teacher turnover is an effective tool for organizations that seek to shift accountability away from school leadership. High teacher attrition is an accountability loophole. Rather than rethink a mission that prizes drilling over teaching, or addressing why young teachers get burned out or why teachers of color walk away from the very communities they are so passionate about, some charter leaders will often put the blame on the leavers. "They couldn’t cut it," you’ll hear them say. They’ll insist to stakeholders that some teachers weren’t good enough, while others weren’t the right "fit" for the organizational mission and culture. The charter school’s organizational leadership and mission remain intact; anyone who is not fighting for "our kids" has been let go.</p><p dir="ltr">But where is the accountability for school and district level leaders who fail to hold onto the sorts of teachers they should be fighting to keep? Where is the accountability for organizations that cheat Black and Brown students who most need the presence of strong adults and seasoned professionals out of continuity and stability? When do leaders stop pointing fingers at "bad apples" and teachers who couldn’t cut it and turn themselves around for the wellbeing of the children these schools serve?</p><p dir="ltr">During my final year of teaching at a Camden, NJ charter school, I was told that my job responsibilities would be changing the next school year. Instead of teaching history or social studies in grades sixth through twelve as I’m certified to do, I was going to be teaching 3rd grade science. Rather than participate in a year of failure for all parties involved, I decided to leave. I guess that means I couldn’t cut it either.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p>  <!-- All divs have been put onto one line because of whitespace issues when rendered inline in browsers -->

I’ve witnessed first hand—and experienced—why this is such a problem, and what causes teachers to flee. But I’ve also seen for myself that there are charter schools and networks that don’t mind high levels of teacher turnover. Turmoil and churn work for organizations that are determined to control both the makeup and the mindset of their faculty.</p><p dir="ltr">To understand why teachers leave charter schools, you have to first look at what their teaching lives are like. When they start out, they work ten to twelve hours and day, then two more hours when they get home. Young and/or inexperienced in the classroom, they believe that they can save the world one child at a time. They drink the proverbial Kool-Aid offered to them by their charter organization. Whatever salary is offered, they accept, knowing that the extra work they do isn’t compensated. But life happens. Those once green teachers grow older, gaining skills, savvy and experience. They seek career advancement opportunities, better pay and a seat at the table. And major life changes—they get married, have kids of their own—demand more time for life outside of school. Some teachers get tired of putting in extra hours every day. Wearing “extra hats” starts to wear thin. They burn out from turbulent working conditions in concert with real issues beyond the appeal of caring adults. The appeal of working for an organization that demands time, labor and allegiance to the mission first (too often raising test scores), and the children second, begins to fade.</p><p dir="ltr">And so these teachers walk away, just in time to be replaced by a new crop of the young, idealistic teachers they once were. Charter school fans often <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.nydailynews.com/opinion/high-teacher-turnover-charter-schools-matter-article-1.3281888">point to</a> teacher turnover as a net positive. Unlike traditional public schools with their union contracts, charters are flushing out the teachers who can’t hack it, and as long as the test scores are going up, who cares how long the teachers stay? But this weeding out process is designed to rid schools of more than just the incompetents. It’s also a way of eliminating teachers who no longer see eye to eye with the organization. As teachers become more confident, in their teaching and in themselves, they start to speak out against what’s wrong—sometimes at the expense of their employment.</p><p dir="ltr">I am not implying that it is the goal of charter schools to intentionally facilitate a mass exodus of teachers at the end of every school year. Yet I heard for myself charter school leaders say that they appreciate how the challenges of urban of education enable them to maintain just the right roster of faculty. At times these leaders expedited the weeding process by subjecting particular teachers to micromanagement and redundant observations. I also witnessed leaders lean on skilled and talented teachers, and teachers of color, requesting that they carry a bit more of the emotional and administrative workload, to "test" whether or not they could meet the demands of the organization.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Weeding out teachers to maintain control</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The weeding process is all about maintaining control where there is none. It serves to remove "troublemakers": the folks who will hold the organization accountable. For charter leadership looking to maintain sovereignty of mission and mission implementation, teachers who are independent thinkers and teachers with lives outside of schools are as much of a detriment as those deemed incompetent. The teachers who remain either like the Kool-Aid or at the very least are still thirsty.</p><p dir="ltr">Teacher turnover is an effective tool for organizations that seek to shift accountability away from school leadership. High teacher attrition is an accountability loophole. Rather than rethink a mission that prizes drilling over teaching, or addressing why young teachers get burned out or why teachers of color walk away from the very communities they are so passionate about, some charter leaders will often put the blame on the leavers. "They couldn’t cut it," you’ll hear them say. They’ll insist to stakeholders that some teachers weren’t good enough, while others weren’t the right "fit" for the organizational mission and culture. The charter school’s organizational leadership and mission remain intact; anyone who is not fighting for "our kids" has been let go.</p><p dir="ltr">But where is the accountability for school and district level leaders who fail to hold onto the sorts of teachers they should be fighting to keep? Where is the accountability for organizations that cheat Black and Brown students who most need the presence of strong adults and seasoned professionals out of continuity and stability? When do leaders stop pointing fingers at "bad apples" and teachers who couldn’t cut it and turn themselves around for the wellbeing of the children these schools serve?</p><p dir="ltr">During my final year of teaching at a Camden, NJ charter school, I was told that my job responsibilities would be changing the next school year. Instead of teaching history or social studies in grades sixth through twelve as I’m certified to do, I was going to be teaching 3rd grade science. Rather than participate in a year of failure for all parties involved, I decided to leave. I guess that means I couldn’t cut it either.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p>  <!-- All divs have been put onto one line because of whitespace issues when rendered inline in browsers -->

<!--smart_paging_autop_filter--> <p>They’re easy to spot, the neo-Nazi and his driver, strolling side by side up Main Street beneath a noonday sun, flanked by the two-story brick and limestone buildings of Beatrice, <a data-link-="" href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/nebraska" name="in body link" id="in body link">Nebraska</a>. But it’s not the way they’re dressed.</p><p>Gerhard Lauck, the man they call the “Farm Belt führer” doesn’t draw attention to himself heedlessly, doesn’t swaddle himself in swastikas – not any more, anyway, and not out here in south-east <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nebraska" name="auto-linked-tag" id="auto-linked-tag">Nebraska</a>, where he finally retreated after serving a four-year stint in a German prison for distributing neo-Nazi propaganda. He doesn’t bark “Heil Hitler!” He doesn’t shoot his right arm into the air.</p><p>No, it’s not the way they’re dressed, though Lauck is wearing a military brown shirt, and his driver, who won’t identify himself, is over-buttoned for a warm spring day. It’s something about their posture, a self-seriousness reflected in their stride, as if they’re not conducting business so much as playing at it.</p><p>At 6ft 4in and roughly 240lb, Lauck towers above his driver. Were it not for his illicit activity abroad, his tireless promotion of “racial purity”, his worship of Adolf Hitler (whom he likes to call “too humane” just to revel in the outrage), the pair would seem almost comical, a Laurel and Hardy, or closer still, a Pinky and the Brain.</p><p>“A joke? He was never a joke,” said Bob Wolfson, former director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Plains States Region, when I questioned Lauck’s significance. “If you’re talking about American Nazis that have had an impact internationally in the last 50 years, Gerhard is probably number one.”</p><p>For Wolfson, Lauck’s trajectory is a valuable case study, a narrative worth repeating to recognize the signs of a budding hatemonger.</p><p>According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, “the radical right was more successful in entering the political mainstream last year (2016) than in half a century”. This extremism has reared its head in forms both violent and purely ideological, from the exploding popularity of websites like the<em> </em>Daily Stormer<em>,</em>founded by an avowed Hitlerite, to the rash of hate crimes <a data-link-="" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/12/16/update-1094-bias-related-incidents-month-following-election" name="in body link" id="in body link">recorded</a> immediately following Donald Trump’s election.</p><p>Lauck fits squarely into a succession of far right ideologues pushing an anti-globalist agenda. But unlike so many shouting their hate today, he has been peddling his particular brand in <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news" name="auto-linked-tag" id="auto-linked-tag">Europe</a> for decades: before, during and after the internet disrupted traditional propaganda channels.</p><p>“His methodology and effect have been changed by technology,” Wolfson says, “but the fact that he’s still running a hosting site, that he hasn’t lost his ability to connect all these groups, that he has very good relationships with thousands and thousands of neo-Nazis all over the world – that’s not insignificant.”</p><p>I watch from across the street as they enter the restaurant. Above them, a crew of Hispanic workers dangle their legs from the scaffolding as they re-mortar the exterior. He’s not concerned. It’s not the individuals that bother him – it’s the groups, slowly “mongrelizing” the planet, he believes, playing the long con of “white genocide”.</p><p>The room is banquet sized and bare. The lights are dim, and the driver, still in his boxy jacket, stands beside our table. He doesn’t greet me when I step inside. I ask if he’s with Gerhard. He nods toward the restroom.</p><p>Seconds later, Lauck barrels out, belly forward, thumbs tucked in his waistband, mustache thick, hair peppered and neatly trimmed.</p><p>The world’s top supplier of printed neo-Nazi propaganda is ready for his first mainstream media interview in years.</p><p>“You do a great public service by saying these folks are around,” says Wolfson, who spent years of his career tracking Lauck’s work. “It’s healthy for people to get close to darkness so they can triangulate what darkness looks like.”</p><p>I first contacted Lauck last February, after studying the Southern Poverty Law Center’s newly published “<a data-link-="" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch" name="in body link" id="in body link">Hate Map</a>”.</p><p>Of the 917 active hate groups shown nationwide, 99 were Nazi groups, and five fell within the borders of my home state of Nebraska. Two of them in the neo-Nazi category: the NDSAP/AO, the German acronym for the National Socialist German Workers Party/Overseas Organization and Third Reich Books, both spearheaded by Gary “Gerhard” Lauck. The former was listed in the capital city of Lincoln, the latter in Fairbury, population 3,800.</p><p>After finding the website for Third Reich Books, I quickly emailed the only address listed, astonished to find someone with Lauck’s history living quietly among us. I didn’t think he would write back, but just 20 minutes later, his response was sitting in my mailbox.</p><p>“I’m semi-retired,” he wrote, “and routinely decline interviews from the local and state media.” If I were writing for a national or international publication, however, he’d be willing to make an exception. Though corresponding with a neo-Nazi fried my nerves – the very thought of his name in my inbox keeping me up at night – we stayed in touch for several months until we finally locked in a time and place to meet.</p><p>In person, Lauck is nothing if not self-aware.</p><p>He jokes about his “excessive modesty” as often as he calls himself a “sex symbol”, which is to say: frequently. He is fine with being called a Nazi propagandist. He doesn’t argue otherwise, though he insists he fabricates “a lot less than most propagandists” and certainly less than “the mass media”. The more appropriate question, he later tells me, isn’t whether or not what he says is true, but how much he’s omitted. He says these things frequently, purposely throwing himself in doubt, relishing in the grey zone between fact and fiction.</p><p>His fluency in German has led many in the past to confuse a very real speech impediment with an affected German accent. He struggles with the “r” sound, substituting a “w” or deleting it entirely. And he often crutches on the phrase “type of thing”, even when the phrase doesn’t apply: “I’m not say’n we should, type of thing, but the conkest of living space to poetect yuh own wace, yuh own culcha is OK.”</p><p>Born in Milwaukee in 1953, Lauck grew up in a bubble of pro-German sentiment. Once nicknamed the “German Athens of America”, by the 1930s Milwaukee hosted the largest German-born population in the country outside of Chicago and New York City. But a host of factors shattered the myth of a monolithic German American community, not the least of which was the political approach to preserving its heritage in the wake of the first world war – an era of fierce anti-German sentiment – and the looming shadow of the Third Reich.</p><p>Lauck’s parents, both from Wisconsin, grew up in this polarizing atmosphere, though he claims they were non-political. “Of course, there were comments about the United States fighting on the wrong side,” he says. “But, after all, that’s pretty obvious.”</p><p>Cocooned by his heritage, Lauck developed an acute sense of family and ethnic identity – something he’d fetishize for the rest of his life.</p><p>“I’ve been an American for over 60 years,” he says. “I’ve been a German for over 4,000.”</p><p>When Lauck was 11, his father Francis, formerly an engineer with the AO Smith Corporation, accepted a professorship at the University of Nebraska, transplanting the family to Lincoln. They moved into a modest home on a quiet, tree-lined street on the eastern edge of the city: middle class, upwardly mobile and overwhelmingly white.</p><p>Though Nebraska, too, boasted significant German heritage, the Germans here were more Americanized, Lauck says. Few of them retained the language, but more than that, they’d lost what he now viewed as the hallmarks of German culture.</p><p>This sudden departure from his nationalistic upbringing in Milwaukee, combined with a burgeoning American counterculture, pushed him over the edge. He considered Lincoln “a spiritually foreign country”.</p><p>He withdrew into books and filled his room with German war regalia. When he finally asked for Mein Kampf, at just 14, it didn’t seem that peculiar for the same precocious kid who’d asked for The Communist Manifesto just the week before. He hated the former, of course. But Mein Kampf “made perfect sense”, crystallizing the pro-German values he was reared on, and ushering forth the “master race” myth he still preaches today.</p><p>He graduated from Lincoln East high school in just three years, sliding further into the national socialist philosophy, submitting essays to Nazi publications and converting both his father and oldest brother Robert to the party.</p><p>In an act of “ethnic consciousness”, he changed his name from Gary to “Gerhard”, and neighbors say he’d often correct them on it. “If Cassius Clay can be Muhammad Ali,” he says, “then Gary Lauck can be Gerhard Lauck.”</p><p>Neighbors say his mother, Laura, was “the sanest one over there”. They remember her with sadness, pointing out she gave everything to that family and seemed to get so little in return. They say Lauck’s sister Janice struggled for years with what the family thought was a mental disorder, only to find out she had a brain tumor.</p><p>What the neighbors didn’t know – what they couldn’t – was that the youngest son of this peculiar Wisconsin family was soon to establish one of the most important and far-reaching neo-Nazi organizations in history, and that he’d do it all in plain sight, right there in his parents’ basement.</p><p>After two years at university, Lauck dropped out to focus his efforts abroad. He first connected with a fledgling cell of neo-Nazis in New York before flying to “the fatherland” in 1972, where he found swastikas and slogans written in graffiti, though no signs of a unified movement. He was arrested for distributing Nazi literature, specifically outlawed by Germany’s criminal code as part of the denazification program following the second world war, but it gave him an idea.</p><p>He describes it in The Education of an Evil Genius, his self-published autobiography:</p><blockquote><p>“An overseas organization based in a free country would supply the underground resistance with professionally produced printed matter. It would have a uniform contact address in the free country. Inquirers would receive free sample literature and their own unique ‘ID number’ for use in future correspondence instead of their real name and address. This protected their identity in the event of a later interception of the mail.”</p></blockquote><p>Thus the National Socialist German Workers Party/Overseas Organization, or NDSAP/AO, was born.</p><p>The idea couldn’t have been simpler, but in the pre-internet age, never before had the neo-Nazi resistance in Europe been so connected. Dissident cells who previously knew nothing of one another were now in communication, and Gerhard Lauck, barely into his 20s, once a bookish teenage pariah, served as the conduit from thousands of miles away.</p><p>It started with a run of just 1,000 swastika stickers mailed to <a data-link-="" href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/germany" name="in body link" id="in body link">Germany</a>. A year later, Lauck writes in his autobiography, the average run was 100,000. Soon, the AO published a German-language newspaper, the NS Kampfruf, and later still, an English version called The National Socialist Report.</p><p>During the next two decades, between 1975 and 1995, he moved around between Lincoln, Chicago and New York, but he always used the same return address on the propaganda. The newspapers expanded to nearly a dozen languages and 30 countries. Bolstered by its own reflection – “We realized we were not just a bunch of old people ready to die,” Lauck says – the resistance movement in Europe, and especially in <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany" name="auto-linked-tag" id="auto-linked-tag">Germany</a>, exploded.</p><p>Though numbers varied widely at the time, the Anti-Defamation League estimated in 1993 that nearly 60,000 Germans were involved in neo-Nazi activity. The German government itself guessed that while only 2,000 Germans fit a strict Nazi mold, nearly 43,000 rightwing extremists were active in various hate groups, and as many as 6,400 had been militarized. Either way, all of the estimates had multiplied significantly since Lauck’s arrival in the 1970s.</p><p>In November 1976, celebrating the 38th anniversary of Kristallnacht, neo-Nazis in Frankfurt plastered the city with AO posters that read: “We are here again. Red Front perish. Don’t buy Jewish.”</p><p>When a rash of antisemitic crimes broke out in Hanover in February 1978, German sources alleged the demonstrators were financed by the AO through a Swiss bank account.</p><p>And when a 26-year-old construction worker shot and killed himself and three foreigners with a pistol at a nightclub in Nuremberg in August 1982, police found his pockets stuffed with AO stickers.</p><p>In 1992, Lauck’s propaganda was found at the crime scene of more than 200 criminal investigations, nearly all of them triggered by violent activities. And in the early days of the Yugoslav wars, Lauck used the AO newspapers to recruit and solicit money for a unit of more than 100 neo-Nazi militants of various nationalities to fight for Croatia, a Nazi ally in the second world war.</p><p>Lauck’s activities were heavily monitored – by the FBI, by the CIA, by the Anti-Defamation League. And yet, Lauck remained virtually untouchable on American soil. Despite his disdain for democracy, he’d armored himself with the First Amendment.</p><p>There were hiccups. Caught in March 1976 with 20,000 stickers, a fake passport and a large sum of money, Lauck spent four and a half months in German prison, or as he calls it, a “state-run luxury hotel”. And he once received a cigar-box sized black powder bomb in the mail, powerful enough to kill anyone within a five- to 10ft radius. That could have been his mother, father or his brother Robert, all of whom frequently picked up his mail. Or it could have been his Lithuanian wife, a sympathizer he met in Chicago named Janina Bareisa.</p><p>His brother Jerry, however, who had publicly disavowed his brother’s ideology, never picked up the mail.</p><p>Lauck says politics had nothing to do with it, but on 7 February , 1978, he loaded a 12-gauge shotgun, aimed it at Jerry and pulled the trigger, wounding him. At the hearing, Jerry – who hadn’t stepped foot in the home for more than two years – testified that he’d stopped by the home to drop off a package for his ailing twin sister, but his father, weak from lung cancer, rebuffed him. Lauck, who kept a shotgun nearby in case of political blowback, heard the commotion and ran upstairs. When Jerry slapped his father, Lauck took aim and fired. The charges, which carried a penalty of up to 50 years, were dropped after Jerry refused to come forward and the time for a speedy trial elapsed.</p><p>None of it slowed Lauck down. Not the deportations. Not the bomb threats. Not the family drama. The mail kept coming. The mail kept going. And by the early 1990s, Lauck was considered “the biggest supplier of neo-Nazi materials in the German scene”, according to Bodo Becker, a spokesman for Germany’s Office for the Protection of the Constitution, established specifically to monitor neo-Nazi activity.</p><p>“That’s what I do,” Lauck says. “It’s a really good job.”</p><p>His sins would catch up with him. In December 1993, after years of frustration with German law enforcement and powerless to prosecute the man perhaps most responsible for their country’s surge in rightwing extremism, then-FBI director Louis Freeh opened an investigation focused on Americans facilitating German neo-Nazis.</p><p>Though he didn’t identify individuals, those who followed the case knew exactly where he’d start.</p><p>Two years later, in March 1995, Lauck was arrested in Denmark on warrants issued from Hamburg via Interpol charging him with 36 separate counts of “distributing propaganda against the German constitution, encouraging racial hatred, inciting criminal acts and participating in a criminal organization.” He was soon extradited to Germany, which had been surveilling his activities and wiretapping his German cohorts. What role, if any, the FBI played in Lauck’s seizure remains unclear, though both Lauck himself and other sources close to the case who asked not to be identified claim US officials were involved.</p><p>Either way, Lauck was sentenced to four years in German prison. He maintains he knew the arrest was coming, citing the continued publication of the NS Kampfruf after his arrest as proof of the AO’s foresight.</p><p>What he wasn’t prepared for, however, was the internet.</p><p>By the time he finished his sentence and returned to the US – Chicago first, and then back to his mother’s basement with his wife in tow – the internet had undercut the importance of his work. Dissident neo-Nazi cells all over the world could now easily connect online, and the print industry had lost nearly all of its currency.</p><p>He entered prison as a king among his people, Wolfson says<strong>.</strong> He<strong> </strong>left as something less.</p><p>Neighbors in Lincoln say he stayed quiet after his return. Often times, one neighbor told me, the only way you could tell he was home at all was the strange smell of cigarettes wafting from the backyard.</p><p>But Lauck wasn’t completely out of the game. In 2000, just a year after his return, he launched a web-hosting platform called Zensurfrei.com, meaning “censorship free”.</p><p>Aimed primarily at European hate groups, the website boasts: “We … believe there is no such thing as ‘hate speech,’ only free speech that is hated by the established authorities. Zensurfrei.com is the first fully managed and secure web hosting provider for those denied access to mainstream hosting due to ‘offensive’ content.”</p><p>In addition to its still expanding web-hosting platform, the AO continues to publish hard-copy translations of original SS literature through its online bookstore, Third Reich Books. In total, they publish over 400 titles in 13 languages, Lauck says, and recently purchased their own binding equipment, moving the entire book-building process in-house.</p><p>“If it was up to me I’d move back to Germany to be on the front lines,” he says. “But it’s not practical … I can do more good here.”</p><p>ter our interview, the photographer and I waited for Lauck and his driver to pull away. I had no interest in following them – not in a clandestine sense, anyway – but I wondered how neighbors felt about an internationally notorious Nazi propagandist camping out quietly among them, so we drove the 30 minutes west, slicing through budding cornfields on Route 136.</p><p>Nevertheless, I hadn’t planned on bumping into Lauck again just five minutes after parking the car.</p><p>He quickly appointed himself my liaison, ushering me into various businesses around town. He asked if I’d like to see his hiking path. We left the square and walked toward the Little Blue river, where the city converted an old rail line for recreational use.</p><p>I questioned him throughout the tour about White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who was once called a “<a data-link-="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/25/opinion/what-does-steve-bannon-want.html?_r=0" name="in body link" id="in body link">white supremacist</a>” by Nancy Pelosi. He considers him “watered down” compared to the “Hitler youth and Wehrmacht” he once knew in Germany; about Donald Trump, whom he calls a transitional figure on the path toward revolution, comparable to “Kerensky in Russia”, admitting “the fact that he could be elected on the message he presented … is extremely significant”.</p><p>I also asked him about the sharp rise in antisemitic crimes in 2017. “The Jews claim that, but a lot of times Jews commit the crimes themselves and fake it to get sympathy,” he says. “You’ll know they’re really making progress if you watch the stock market for a company that manufactures a lot of Zyklon B.”</p><p>Lauck purchased a house some time around 2008. By then, his father had long been dead, and Lauck had let his parents’ home fall into disrepair, termites eating the floors and even the base of his mother’s piano.</p><p>Neighbors say he rarely took his mother out of the house. He eventually moved her to a nursing home outside of Lincoln, hastily packing up their belongings and what remained of his operations in the basement. A short string of new owners moved in and out. Nobody stuck around.</p><p>Most residents here in Fairbury don’t recognize his name. Those who do raise their eyebrows, whisper about his activities, laugh them away as if it were a quirk of this avid walker’s past. They don’t condone Nazism, certainly, but they won’t run him off. They respect his privacy, and expect he’ll reciprocate. “As long as he stays outta my yard I don’t care what he does,” says David George, who owns Pla Mor Lanes and Café. “As long as he stays on his side of the fence I won’t have to put a barrel in his face.”</p><p>Lauck asks that I keep Fairbury out of the story, telling me a cautionary tale of blackmailing a journalist who spied on his mother. He tells me it isn’t a threat.</p><p>“If I wanted to threaten you I’d have just taken you out further into the woods and pulled out my Luger and pointed it at you.”</p><p>In 2008, a Baghdadi construction worker named Rafid Al Nada, fearing for his young family’s safety in a radicalized Iraq, began trudging his way through the application process for an American visa.</p><p>After five interviews, they landed in Lincoln, Nebraska. Al Nada found employment with a local construction company, where he could put his considerable skills to work. At first they lived with his cousin, then an apartment of their own, and then a small house. In 2015, they upgraded again, this time into a modest home on a quiet, tree-lined street on the eastern side of the city: middle class, upwardly mobile and overwhelmingly white.</p><p>The yard was a mess and the floors were completely rotted through. Luckily for them, they knew a guy who could fix it up cheap, a skilled handyman with decades of experience behind him.</p><p>They’re still working on the yard, but the interior today is in impeccable condition. New floors. New paint. Framed photos of family members hanging from the walls, not a single one atilt. He built a new front porch. He paved a new sidewalk to the front door. He hasn’t finished the basement yet, but it’s on the list. When they first moved in, he says, he found something strange down there.</p><p>“He found a book talking about Hitler and things,” his son Mustafa says in perfect English, translating for his father.</p><p>I ask if I can see it. Al Nada laughs and gestures towards the trash can.</p><p>“I’m sorry, my friend. I tossed it.”</p><p> </p> &nbsp;<h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="http://www.alternet.org/right-wing/michael-savage-quotes-hitler-condemn-obama">&#039;Hitler Said It Best&#039;—Trump Ally Michael Savage Approvingly Quotes Hitler to Condemn Obama</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="http://www.alternet.org/right-wing/understanding-contemporary-white-supremacy-alt-right-really-something-new">The Alt-Right Is the Modern, Hideous Face of White Supremacy</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="http://www.alternet.org/right-wing/libertarian-strategy-make-america-screwed-texas">This Libertarian Strategy to Make America as Screwed-Up as Texas</a></li></ul>

<!--smart_paging_autop_filter--> <p>They’re easy to spot, the neo-Nazi and his driver, strolling side by side up Main Street beneath a noonday sun, flanked by the two-story brick and limestone buildings of Beatrice, <a data-link-="" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/nebraska" name="in body link" id="in body link">Nebraska</a>. But it’s not the way they’re dressed.</p><p>Gerhard Lauck, the man they call the “Farm Belt führer” doesn’t draw attention to himself heedlessly, doesn’t swaddle himself in swastikas – not any more, anyway, and not out here in south-east <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-="" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nebraska" name="auto-linked-tag" id="auto-linked-tag">Nebraska</a>, where he finally retreated after serving a four-year stint in a German prison for distributing neo-Nazi propaganda. He doesn’t bark “Heil Hitler!” He doesn’t shoot his right arm into the air.</p><p>No, it’s not the way they’re dressed, though Lauck is wearing a military brown shirt, and his driver, who won’t identify himself, is over-buttoned for a warm spring day. It’s something about their posture, a self-seriousness reflected in their stride, as if they’re not conducting business so much as playing at it.</p><p>At 6ft 4in and roughly 240lb, Lauck towers above his driver. Were it not for his illicit activity abroad, his tireless promotion of “racial purity”, his worship of Adolf Hitler (whom he likes to call “too humane” just to revel in the outrage), the pair would seem almost comical, a Laurel and Hardy, or closer still, a Pinky and the Brain.</p><p>“A joke? He was never a joke,” said Bob Wolfson, former director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Plains States Region, when I questioned Lauck’s significance. “If you’re talking about American Nazis that have had an impact internationally in the last 50 years, Gerhard is probably number one.”</p><p>For Wolfson, Lauck’s trajectory is a valuable case study, a narrative worth repeating to recognize the signs of a budding hatemonger.</p><p>According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, “the radical right was more successful in entering the political mainstream last year (2016) than in half a century”. This extremism has reared its head in forms both violent and purely ideological, from the exploding popularity of websites like the<em> </em>Daily Stormer<em>,</em>founded by an avowed Hitlerite, to the rash of hate crimes <a data-link-="" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/12/16/update-1094-bias-related-incidents-month-following-election" name="in body link" id="in body link">recorded</a> immediately following Donald Trump’s election.</p><p>Lauck fits squarely into a succession of far right ideologues pushing an anti-globalist agenda. But unlike so many shouting their hate today, he has been peddling his particular brand in <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-="" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news" name="auto-linked-tag" id="auto-linked-tag">Europe</a> for decades: before, during and after the internet disrupted traditional propaganda channels.</p><p>“His methodology and effect have been changed by technology,” Wolfson says, “but the fact that he’s still running a hosting site, that he hasn’t lost his ability to connect all these groups, that he has very good relationships with thousands and thousands of neo-Nazis all over the world – that’s not insignificant.”</p><p>I watch from across the street as they enter the restaurant. Above them, a crew of Hispanic workers dangle their legs from the scaffolding as they re-mortar the exterior. He’s not concerned. It’s not the individuals that bother him – it’s the groups, slowly “mongrelizing” the planet, he believes, playing the long con of “white genocide”.</p><p>The room is banquet sized and bare. The lights are dim, and the driver, still in his boxy jacket, stands beside our table. He doesn’t greet me when I step inside. I ask if he’s with Gerhard. He nods toward the restroom.</p><p>Seconds later, Lauck barrels out, belly forward, thumbs tucked in his waistband, mustache thick, hair peppered and neatly trimmed.</p><p>The world’s top supplier of printed neo-Nazi propaganda is ready for his first mainstream media interview in years.</p><p>“You do a great public service by saying these folks are around,” says Wolfson, who spent years of his career tracking Lauck’s work. “It’s healthy for people to get close to darkness so they can triangulate what darkness looks like.”</p><p>I first contacted Lauck last February, after studying the Southern Poverty Law Center’s newly published “<a data-link-="" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch" name="in body link" id="in body link">Hate Map</a>”.</p><p>Of the 917 active hate groups shown nationwide, 99 were Nazi groups, and five fell within the borders of my home state of Nebraska. Two of them in the neo-Nazi category: the NDSAP/AO, the German acronym for the National Socialist German Workers Party/Overseas Organization and Third Reich Books, both spearheaded by Gary “Gerhard” Lauck. The former was listed in the capital city of Lincoln, the latter in Fairbury, population 3,800.</p><p>After finding the website for Third Reich Books, I quickly emailed the only address listed, astonished to find someone with Lauck’s history living quietly among us. I didn’t think he would write back, but just 20 minutes later, his response was sitting in my mailbox.</p><p>“I’m semi-retired,” he wrote, “and routinely decline interviews from the local and state media.” If I were writing for a national or international publication, however, he’d be willing to make an exception. Though corresponding with a neo-Nazi fried my nerves – the very thought of his name in my inbox keeping me up at night – we stayed in touch for several months until we finally locked in a time and place to meet.</p><p>In person, Lauck is nothing if not self-aware.</p><p>He jokes about his “excessive modesty” as often as he calls himself a “sex symbol”, which is to say: frequently. He is fine with being called a Nazi propagandist. He doesn’t argue otherwise, though he insists he fabricates “a lot less than most propagandists” and certainly less than “the mass media”. The more appropriate question, he later tells me, isn’t whether or not what he says is true, but how much he’s omitted. He says these things frequently, purposely throwing himself in doubt, relishing in the grey zone between fact and fiction.</p><p>His fluency in German has led many in the past to confuse a very real speech impediment with an affected German accent. He struggles with the “r” sound, substituting a “w” or deleting it entirely. And he often crutches on the phrase “type of thing”, even when the phrase doesn’t apply: “I’m not say’n we should, type of thing, but the conkest of living space to poetect yuh own wace, yuh own culcha is OK.”</p><p>Born in Milwaukee in 1953, Lauck grew up in a bubble of pro-German sentiment. Once nicknamed the “German Athens of America”, by the 1930s Milwaukee hosted the largest German-born population in the country outside of Chicago and New York City. But a host of factors shattered the myth of a monolithic German American community, not the least of which was the political approach to preserving its heritage in the wake of the first world war – an era of fierce anti-German sentiment – and the looming shadow of the Third Reich.</p><p>Lauck’s parents, both from Wisconsin, grew up in this polarizing atmosphere, though he claims they were non-political. “Of course, there were comments about the United States fighting on the wrong side,” he says. “But, after all, that’s pretty obvious.”</p><p>Cocooned by his heritage, Lauck developed an acute sense of family and ethnic identity – something he’d fetishize for the rest of his life.</p><p>“I’ve been an American for over 60 years,” he says. “I’ve been a German for over 4,000.”</p><p>When Lauck was 11, his father Francis, formerly an engineer with the AO Smith Corporation, accepted a professorship at the University of Nebraska, transplanting the family to Lincoln. They moved into a modest home on a quiet, tree-lined street on the eastern edge of the city: middle class, upwardly mobile and overwhelmingly white.</p><p>Though Nebraska, too, boasted significant German heritage, the Germans here were more Americanized, Lauck says. Few of them retained the language, but more than that, they’d lost what he now viewed as the hallmarks of German culture.</p><p>This sudden departure from his nationalistic upbringing in Milwaukee, combined with a burgeoning American counterculture, pushed him over the edge. He considered Lincoln “a spiritually foreign country”.</p><p>He withdrew into books and filled his room with German war regalia. When he finally asked for Mein Kampf, at just 14, it didn’t seem that peculiar for the same precocious kid who’d asked for The Communist Manifesto just the week before. He hated the former, of course. But Mein Kampf “made perfect sense”, crystallizing the pro-German values he was reared on, and ushering forth the “master race” myth he still preaches today.</p><p>He graduated from Lincoln East high school in just three years, sliding further into the national socialist philosophy, submitting essays to Nazi publications and converting both his father and oldest brother Robert to the party.</p><p>In an act of “ethnic consciousness”, he changed his name from Gary to “Gerhard”, and neighbors say he’d often correct them on it. “If Cassius Clay can be Muhammad Ali,” he says, “then Gary Lauck can be Gerhard Lauck.”</p><p>Neighbors say his mother, Laura, was “the sanest one over there”. They remember her with sadness, pointing out she gave everything to that family and seemed to get so little in return. They say Lauck’s sister Janice struggled for years with what the family thought was a mental disorder, only to find out she had a brain tumor.</p><p>What the neighbors didn’t know – what they couldn’t – was that the youngest son of this peculiar Wisconsin family was soon to establish one of the most important and far-reaching neo-Nazi organizations in history, and that he’d do it all in plain sight, right there in his parents’ basement.</p><p>After two years at university, Lauck dropped out to focus his efforts abroad. He first connected with a fledgling cell of neo-Nazis in New York before flying to “the fatherland” in 1972, where he found swastikas and slogans written in graffiti, though no signs of a unified movement. He was arrested for distributing Nazi literature, specifically outlawed by Germany’s criminal code as part of the denazification program following the second world war, but it gave him an idea.</p><p>He describes it in The Education of an Evil Genius, his self-published autobiography:</p><blockquote><p>“An overseas organization based in a free country would supply the underground resistance with professionally produced printed matter. It would have a uniform contact address in the free country. Inquirers would receive free sample literature and their own unique ‘ID number’ for use in future correspondence instead of their real name and address. This protected their identity in the event of a later interception of the mail.”</p></blockquote><p>Thus the National Socialist German Workers Party/Overseas Organization, or NDSAP/AO, was born.</p><p>The idea couldn’t have been simpler, but in the pre-internet age, never before had the neo-Nazi resistance in Europe been so connected. Dissident cells who previously knew nothing of one another were now in communication, and Gerhard Lauck, barely into his 20s, once a bookish teenage pariah, served as the conduit from thousands of miles away.</p><p>It started with a run of just 1,000 swastika stickers mailed to <a data-link-="" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/germany" name="in body link" id="in body link">Germany</a>. A year later, Lauck writes in his autobiography, the average run was 100,000. Soon, the AO published a German-language newspaper, the NS Kampfruf, and later still, an English version called The National Socialist Report.</p><p>During the next two decades, between 1975 and 1995, he moved around between Lincoln, Chicago and New York, but he always used the same return address on the propaganda. The newspapers expanded to nearly a dozen languages and 30 countries. Bolstered by its own reflection – “We realized we were not just a bunch of old people ready to die,” Lauck says – the resistance movement in Europe, and especially in <a data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-="" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany" name="auto-linked-tag" id="auto-linked-tag">Germany</a>, exploded.</p><p>Though numbers varied widely at the time, the Anti-Defamation League estimated in 1993 that nearly 60,000 Germans were involved in neo-Nazi activity. The German government itself guessed that while only 2,000 Germans fit a strict Nazi mold, nearly 43,000 rightwing extremists were active in various hate groups, and as many as 6,400 had been militarized. Either way, all of the estimates had multiplied significantly since Lauck’s arrival in the 1970s.</p><p>In November 1976, celebrating the 38th anniversary of Kristallnacht, neo-Nazis in Frankfurt plastered the city with AO posters that read: “We are here again. Red Front perish. Don’t buy Jewish.”</p><p>When a rash of antisemitic crimes broke out in Hanover in February 1978, German sources alleged the demonstrators were financed by the AO through a Swiss bank account.</p><p>And when a 26-year-old construction worker shot and killed himself and three foreigners with a pistol at a nightclub in Nuremberg in August 1982, police found his pockets stuffed with AO stickers.</p><p>In 1992, Lauck’s propaganda was found at the crime scene of more than 200 criminal investigations, nearly all of them triggered by violent activities. And in the early days of the Yugoslav wars, Lauck used the AO newspapers to recruit and solicit money for a unit of more than 100 neo-Nazi militants of various nationalities to fight for Croatia, a Nazi ally in the second world war.</p><p>Lauck’s activities were heavily monitored – by the FBI, by the CIA, by the Anti-Defamation League. And yet, Lauck remained virtually untouchable on American soil. Despite his disdain for democracy, he’d armored himself with the First Amendment.</p><p>There were hiccups. Caught in March 1976 with 20,000 stickers, a fake passport and a large sum of money, Lauck spent four and a half months in German prison, or as he calls it, a “state-run luxury hotel”. And he once received a cigar-box sized black powder bomb in the mail, powerful enough to kill anyone within a five- to 10ft radius. That could have been his mother, father or his brother Robert, all of whom frequently picked up his mail. Or it could have been his Lithuanian wife, a sympathizer he met in Chicago named Janina Bareisa.</p><p>His brother Jerry, however, who had publicly disavowed his brother’s ideology, never picked up the mail.</p><p>Lauck says politics had nothing to do with it, but on 7 February , 1978, he loaded a 12-gauge shotgun, aimed it at Jerry and pulled the trigger, wounding him. At the hearing, Jerry – who hadn’t stepped foot in the home for more than two years – testified that he’d stopped by the home to drop off a package for his ailing twin sister, but his father, weak from lung cancer, rebuffed him. Lauck, who kept a shotgun nearby in case of political blowback, heard the commotion and ran upstairs. When Jerry slapped his father, Lauck took aim and fired. The charges, which carried a penalty of up to 50 years, were dropped after Jerry refused to come forward and the time for a speedy trial elapsed.</p><p>None of it slowed Lauck down. Not the deportations. Not the bomb threats. Not the family drama. The mail kept coming. The mail kept going. And by the early 1990s, Lauck was considered “the biggest supplier of neo-Nazi materials in the German scene”, according to Bodo Becker, a spokesman for Germany’s Office for the Protection of the Constitution, established specifically to monitor neo-Nazi activity.</p><p>“That’s what I do,” Lauck says. “It’s a really good job.”</p><p>His sins would catch up with him. In December 1993, after years of frustration with German law enforcement and powerless to prosecute the man perhaps most responsible for their country’s surge in rightwing extremism, then-FBI director Louis Freeh opened an investigation focused on Americans facilitating German neo-Nazis.</p><p>Though he didn’t identify individuals, those who followed the case knew exactly where he’d start.</p><p>Two years later, in March 1995, Lauck was arrested in Denmark on warrants issued from Hamburg via Interpol charging him with 36 separate counts of “distributing propaganda against the German constitution, encouraging racial hatred, inciting criminal acts and participating in a criminal organization.” He was soon extradited to Germany, which had been surveilling his activities and wiretapping his German cohorts. What role, if any, the FBI played in Lauck’s seizure remains unclear, though both Lauck himself and other sources close to the case who asked not to be identified claim US officials were involved.</p><p>Either way, Lauck was sentenced to four years in German prison. He maintains he knew the arrest was coming, citing the continued publication of the NS Kampfruf after his arrest as proof of the AO’s foresight.</p><p>What he wasn’t prepared for, however, was the internet.</p><p>By the time he finished his sentence and returned to the US – Chicago first, and then back to his mother’s basement with his wife in tow – the internet had undercut the importance of his work. Dissident neo-Nazi cells all over the world could now easily connect online, and the print industry had lost nearly all of its currency.</p><p>He entered prison as a king among his people, Wolfson says<strong>.</strong> He<strong> </strong>left as something less.</p><p>Neighbors in Lincoln say he stayed quiet after his return. Often times, one neighbor told me, the only way you could tell he was home at all was the strange smell of cigarettes wafting from the backyard.</p><p>But Lauck wasn’t completely out of the game. In 2000, just a year after his return, he launched a web-hosting platform called Zensurfrei.com, meaning “censorship free”.</p><p>Aimed primarily at European hate groups, the website boasts: “We … believe there is no such thing as ‘hate speech,’ only free speech that is hated by the established authorities. Zensurfrei.com is the first fully managed and secure web hosting provider for those denied access to mainstream hosting due to ‘offensive’ content.”</p><p>In addition to its still expanding web-hosting platform, the AO continues to publish hard-copy translations of original SS literature through its online bookstore, Third Reich Books. In total, they publish over 400 titles in 13 languages, Lauck says, and recently purchased their own binding equipment, moving the entire book-building process in-house.</p><p>“If it was up to me I’d move back to Germany to be on the front lines,” he says. “But it’s not practical … I can do more good here.”</p><p>ter our interview, the photographer and I waited for Lauck and his driver to pull away. I had no interest in following them – not in a clandestine sense, anyway – but I wondered how neighbors felt about an internationally notorious Nazi propagandist camping out quietly among them, so we drove the 30 minutes west, slicing through budding cornfields on Route 136.</p><p>Nevertheless, I hadn’t planned on bumping into Lauck again just five minutes after parking the car.</p><p>He quickly appointed himself my liaison, ushering me into various businesses around town. He asked if I’d like to see his hiking path. We left the square and walked toward the Little Blue river, where the city converted an old rail line for recreational use.</p><p>I questioned him throughout the tour about White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who was once called a “<a data-link-="" href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/25/opinion/what-does-steve-bannon-want.html?_r=0" name="in body link" id="in body link">white supremacist</a>” by Nancy Pelosi. He considers him “watered down” compared to the “Hitler youth and Wehrmacht” he once knew in Germany; about Donald Trump, whom he calls a transitional figure on the path toward revolution, comparable to “Kerensky in Russia”, admitting “the fact that he could be elected on the message he presented … is extremely significant”.</p><p>I also asked him about the sharp rise in antisemitic crimes in 2017. “The Jews claim that, but a lot of times Jews commit the crimes themselves and fake it to get sympathy,” he says. “You’ll know they’re really making progress if you watch the stock market for a company that manufactures a lot of Zyklon B.”</p><p>Lauck purchased a house some time around 2008. By then, his father had long been dead, and Lauck had let his parents’ home fall into disrepair, termites eating the floors and even the base of his mother’s piano.</p><p>Neighbors say he rarely took his mother out of the house. He eventually moved her to a nursing home outside of Lincoln, hastily packing up their belongings and what remained of his operations in the basement. A short string of new owners moved in and out. Nobody stuck around.</p><p>Most residents here in Fairbury don’t recognize his name. Those who do raise their eyebrows, whisper about his activities, laugh them away as if it were a quirk of this avid walker’s past. They don’t condone Nazism, certainly, but they won’t run him off. They respect his privacy, and expect he’ll reciprocate. “As long as he stays outta my yard I don’t care what he does,” says David George, who owns Pla Mor Lanes and Café. “As long as he stays on his side of the fence I won’t have to put a barrel in his face.”</p><p>Lauck asks that I keep Fairbury out of the story, telling me a cautionary tale of blackmailing a journalist who spied on his mother. He tells me it isn’t a threat.</p><p>“If I wanted to threaten you I’d have just taken you out further into the woods and pulled out my Luger and pointed it at you.”</p><p>In 2008, a Baghdadi construction worker named Rafid Al Nada, fearing for his young family’s safety in a radicalized Iraq, began trudging his way through the application process for an American visa.</p><p>After five interviews, they landed in Lincoln, Nebraska. Al Nada found employment with a local construction company, where he could put his considerable skills to work. At first they lived with his cousin, then an apartment of their own, and then a small house. In 2015, they upgraded again, this time into a modest home on a quiet, tree-lined street on the eastern side of the city: middle class, upwardly mobile and overwhelmingly white.</p><p>The yard was a mess and the floors were completely rotted through. Luckily for them, they knew a guy who could fix it up cheap, a skilled handyman with decades of experience behind him.</p><p>They’re still working on the yard, but the interior today is in impeccable condition. New floors. New paint. Framed photos of family members hanging from the walls, not a single one atilt. He built a new front porch. He paved a new sidewalk to the front door. He hasn’t finished the basement yet, but it’s on the list. When they first moved in, he says, he found something strange down there.</p><p>“He found a book talking about Hitler and things,” his son Mustafa says in perfect English, translating for his father.</p><p>I ask if I can see it. Al Nada laughs and gestures towards the trash can.</p><p>“I’m sorry, my friend. I tossed it.”</p><p> </p> <Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" alt="" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/393293956/0/alternet">

Reprinted with permission from Beacon Press.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Unconventional ideas can appear from anywhere, even the most conventional of places.</p><p dir="ltr">The township of Concord in Michigan is one of those places. Home to fewer than three thousand people, it’s an almost entirely white corner of America. The area’s biggest attraction is a preserved post–Civil War house covered in pale clapboard siding. In 1894, not long after this house was built, a middle-aged schoolteacher from right here in Concord published some of the most radical ideas of her age. Her name was Eliza Burt Gamble.</p><p dir="ltr">We don’t know much about Gamble’s personal life, except that she was a woman who had no choice but to be independent. She had lost her father when she was two, her mother when she was around sixteen. Left without support, she made a living by teaching at local public schools. According to some reports, she went on to achieve impressive heights in her career. She also married and had three children, two of whom died before the century was out. Gamble’s life could have been mapped out for her, the way it was for most middle-class women. She could have been a quiet, submissive housewife of the kind celebrated by the poet Coventry Patmore. Instead, she joined the growing suffrage movement to fight for the equal rights of women, becoming one of the most important campaigners in her region. In 1876 she organized the first women’s suffrage conference in her home state of Michigan.</p><p dir="ltr">Gamble believed there was more to the cause than securing legal equality. One of the biggest sticking points in the fight for women’s rights, she recognized, was that society had come to believe women were built to be lesser than men. Convinced this was wrong, in 1885 she set out to find hard proof for herself. She spent a year studying the collections at the Library of Congress, scouring the books for evidence. She was driven, she wrote, “with no special object in view other than a desire for information.”</p><p dir="ltr">Evolutionary theory, despite what Charles Darwin had written about women, actually offered great promise to the women’s movement. It opened a door to a revolutionary new way to understand humans. “It meant a way to be modern,” says historian Kimberly Hamlin, whose 2014 book <em>From Eve to Evolution: Darwin, Science, and Women’s Rights in Gilded Age America</em> charts women’s responses to Darwin. Evolution was an alternative to religious stories that painted woman as man’s spare rib. Christian models for female behavior and virtue were challenged. “Darwin created a space where women could say that maybe the Garden of Eden didn’t happen . . . and this was huge. You cannot overestimate how important Adam and Eve were in terms of constraining and shaping people’s ideas about women.”</p><p dir="ltr">Although not a scientist herself, through Darwin’s work Gamble realized just how devastating the scientific method could be. If humans were descended from lesser creatures, the same as all other life on earth, then it made no sense for women to be confined to the home or subservient to men. These obviously weren’t the rules in the rest of the animal kingdom. “It would be unnatural for women to sit around and be totally dependent on men,” Hamlin tells me. The story of women could be rewritten.</p><p dir="ltr">In reality of course, for all the latent revolutionary power in his ideas, Darwin himself never believed that women were the intellectual equals of men. And this wasn’t just a disappointment to Gamble but, judging from her writing, a source of great anger. She believed that Darwin, though correct in concluding that humans evolved like every other living thing on earth, was clearly wrong when it came to the role that women had played in human evolution.</p><p dir="ltr">Her criticisms were passionately laid out in a book she published in 1894 called <em>The Evolution of Woman, an Inquiry into the Dogma of Her Inferiority to Man</em>. “It was shocking,” says Hamlin. Marshalling history, statistics, and science, this was Gamble’s piercing counterargument to Darwin and other evolutionary biologists. She angrily tweezed out their inconsistencies and double standards. The peacock might have had the bigger feathers, she argued, but the peahen still had to exercise her faculties in choosing the best mate. And on the one hand, Darwin suggested that gorillas were too big and strong to become higher social creatures like humans. Yet at the same time he used the fact that men are on average physically bigger than women as evidence of their superiority.</p><p dir="ltr">He had also failed to notice, Gamble wrote, that the human qualities associated more commonly with women—cooperation, nurture, protectiveness, egalitarianism, and altruism—must have played a vital role in human progress. In evolutionary terms, drawing assumptions about women’s abilities from the way they happened to be treated by society at that moment was narrow-minded and dangerous. Women had been systematically suppressed over the course of human history by men and their power structures, Gamble argued. They weren’t naturally inferior. They just seemed that way because they hadn’t been allowed the chance to develop their talents. Gamble suggested that Darwin hadn’t accounted for the existence of powerful women in some tribal societies either, which might prove that the supremacy of men now was not how it had always been. The ancient Hindu text the Mahabharata, which she picks out as an example, spoke of women being unconfined and independent before marriage was invented. So she couldn’t help but wonder if “the law of equal transmission” applied to men as well as women: might it not be possible that males had been dragged along by the superior female of the species?</p><p dir="ltr">“When a man and woman are put into competition, both possessed of every mental quality in equal perfection, save that one has higher energy, more patience and a somewhat greater degree of physical courage, while the other has superior powers of intuition, finer and more rapid perceptions and a greater degree of endurance, . . . the chances of the latter for gaining the ascendancy will doubtless be equal to those of the former,” she argues.</p><p dir="ltr">Eliza Burt Gamble’s message, like that of other scientific suffragists, proved popular. Their provocative message was that women had been cheated out of the lives they deserved, that equality was in fact their biological right. “It seemed clear to me that the history of the life on the earth presents an unbroken chain of evidence going to prove the importance of the female,” Gamble writes in the preface to the revised edition, which came out in 1916.</p><p dir="ltr">But even an army of readers and the support of fellow activists couldn’t help win biologists around to her point of view. Her arguments were doomed to never fully enter the scientific mainstream, only circulate outside it.</p><p dir="ltr">But she never gave up. She marched on in her campaign for women’s rights and continued writing for the press. Fortunately, she lived just long enough to see her own work as well as that of the wider movement gain real strength. In 1893 New Zealand became the first self-governing country to grant women the vote. The battle would take until 1918 in Britain, although only for women over the age of thirty. And when Gamble died in Detroit in 1920, it was just a month after the United States ratified the Nineteenth Amendment, which prohibited citizens from being denied the right to vote because of their sex.</p><p dir="ltr">While the political battle was a success, the war to change people’s minds was taking much longer. “Gamble’s ideas were praised in reform magazines and her writing style was generally praised, but the scientific and mainstream press balked at her conclusions and at her pretensions to write about ‘science,’” says Hamlin. The Evolution of Woman was quite widely reviewed in newspapers and academic journals, but scarcely left a dent on science. “They were just like, ‘Those silly women and their silly ideas.’”</p><p dir="ltr">A scathing book review in the <em>American Journal of Sociology</em> in 1915 reveals just how desperately some scientists clung to their prejudices, even when society around them was changing. “It must have been a sense of humor which led the publishers to put this volume in their ‘Science Series,’” wrote the Texas University sociologist and liberal thinker Albert Wolfe about <em>Sex Antagonism</em>, the latest work of the respected British biologist Walter Heape. Heape had taken his considerable scientific knowledge of reproductive biology and applied it somewhat less objectively to society, arguing that equality between the sexes was impossible because men and women were built for different roles.</p><p dir="ltr">Many biologists at the time agreed with Heape, including Scottish naturalist and coauthor of <em>The Evolution of Sex</em>, John Arthur Thompson, who gave the book a positive review. But Wolfe immediately saw the danger in scientists like him overstepping their expertise. “It is a fi ne illustration of the sort of mental pathology a scientist, especially a biologist, can exhibit when, with slight acquaintance with other fields than his own, he ventures to dictate from ‘natural law’ (with which Mr Heape claims to be in most intimate acquaintance) what social and ethical relation shall be,” Wolfe mocked in his review. “He sees only disaster and perversion in the modern woman movement.”</p><p dir="ltr">Parts of science remained doggedly slow to change. Evolutionary theory progressed pretty much as always, learning few lessons from critics such as Albert Wolfe, Caroline Kennard, and Eliza Burt Gamble. It’s hard to picture the directions in which science might have gone if in those important days when Charles Darwin developed his theories of evolution, society hadn’t been as sexist as it was. We can only imagine how different our understanding of women might be now if Gamble had been taken more seriously. Historians today have regrettably described her radical perspective as the road not taken.</p><p dir="ltr">In the century after Gamble’s death, researchers became only more obsessed by sex differences, how they might pick them out, measure and catalogue them, enforcing the dogma that men are somehow better than women.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Excerpted from</em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inferior-Science-Wrong-Research-Rewriting/dp/0807071706/?tag=alternorg08-20" target="_blank">Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong—and the New Research That's Rewriting the Story</a><em>by Angela Saini (Beacon Press, 2017).

Their provocative message was that women had been cheated out of the lives they deserved, that equality was in fact their biological right. “It seemed clear to me that the history of the life on the earth presents an unbroken chain of evidence going to prove the importance of the female,” Gamble writes in the preface to the revised edition, which came out in 1916.</p><p dir="ltr">But even an army of readers and the support of fellow activists couldn’t help win biologists around to her point of view. Her arguments were doomed to never fully enter the scientific mainstream, only circulate outside it.</p><p dir="ltr">But she never gave up. She marched on in her campaign for women’s rights and continued writing for the press. Fortunately, she lived just long enough to see her own work as well as that of the wider movement gain real strength. In 1893 New Zealand became the first self-governing country to grant women the vote. The battle would take until 1918 in Britain, although only for women over the age of thirty. And when Gamble died in Detroit in 1920, it was just a month after the United States ratified the Nineteenth Amendment, which prohibited citizens from being denied the right to vote because of their sex.</p><p dir="ltr">While the political battle was a success, the war to change people’s minds was taking much longer. “Gamble’s ideas were praised in reform magazines and her writing style was generally praised, but the scientific and mainstream press balked at her conclusions and at her pretensions to write about ‘science,’” says Hamlin. The Evolution of Woman was quite widely reviewed in newspapers and academic journals, but scarcely left a dent on science. “They were just like, ‘Those silly women and their silly ideas.’”</p><p dir="ltr">A scathing book review in the <em>American Journal of Sociology</em> in 1915 reveals just how desperately some scientists clung to their prejudices, even when society around them was changing. “It must have been a sense of humor which led the publishers to put this volume in their ‘Science Series,’” wrote the Texas University sociologist and liberal thinker Albert Wolfe about <em>Sex Antagonism</em>, the latest work of the respected British biologist Walter Heape. Heape had taken his considerable scientific knowledge of reproductive biology and applied it somewhat less objectively to society, arguing that equality between the sexes was impossible because men and women were built for different roles.</p><p dir="ltr">Many biologists at the time agreed with Heape, including Scottish naturalist and coauthor of <em>The Evolution of Sex</em>, John Arthur Thompson, who gave the book a positive review. But Wolfe immediately saw the danger in scientists like him overstepping their expertise. “It is a fi ne illustration of the sort of mental pathology a scientist, especially a biologist, can exhibit when, with slight acquaintance with other fields than his own, he ventures to dictate from ‘natural law’ (with which Mr Heape claims to be in most intimate acquaintance) what social and ethical relation shall be,” Wolfe mocked in his review. “He sees only disaster and perversion in the modern woman movement.”</p><p dir="ltr">Parts of science remained doggedly slow to change. Evolutionary theory progressed pretty much as always, learning few lessons from critics such as Albert Wolfe, Caroline Kennard, and Eliza Burt Gamble. It’s hard to picture the directions in which science might have gone if in those important days when Charles Darwin developed his theories of evolution, society hadn’t been as sexist as it was. We can only imagine how different our understanding of women might be now if Gamble had been taken more seriously. Historians today have regrettably described her radical perspective as the road not taken.</p><p dir="ltr">In the century after Gamble’s death, researchers became only more obsessed by sex differences, how they might pick them out, measure and catalogue them, enforcing the dogma that men are somehow better than women.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Excerpted from</em> <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.amazon.com/Inferior-Science-Wrong-Research-Rewriting/dp/0807071706/?tag=alternorg08-20" target="_blank">Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong—and the New Research That&#039;s Rewriting the Story</a><em>by Angela Saini (Beacon Press, 2017).

 <!--smart_paging_autop_filter--><p>A universe of organisms living inside you may affect every part of your body, from your brain to your bones, and even your thoughts, feelings and your attempts to lose weight.</p><p>This is a universe of trillions of microorganisms – or what we biologists call <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/humanmicrobiota/index.html">microbiota</a> – that live in your gut, the part of your body responsible for digestion of the food you eat and the liquids you drink.</p><p>As researchers, we have been looking increasingly into the effect these bacteria have on their host’s body, from obesity to mental illness and heart disease. With obesity, for example, these tiny organisms may play a big role by influencing what foods we crave and how our bodies hold onto fat.</p><p>In a recent study of the <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphys.2017.00220/full">gut microbiome</a>, we set out to determine whether the microbiota in the gut can be affected not only by our nervous system but also by an unsuspected source – our bone marrow.</p><p>Our hope is that, by understanding the interactions of the microbiome with other parts of the body, one day treatments could be developed for a range of illnesses.</p><p><strong>The gut-brain-bone marrow connection</strong></p><p>The gut, which includes your esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, colon and other parts of your digestive system, is the first line of defense and the largest interface between the host – in this case, a person – and the outside world.</p><p>After birth, the gut is the first point of entry for environmental and dietary influences on human life. Thus, the microbiota in the gut play a crucial role during human growth, as they contribute to development and maintenance of our immune system throughout our lifetime.</p><p>While we initially thought of the microbiota as relatively simple organisms, the fact is that they may not be so simple after all. Gut microbiota can be as personal and complex as a fingerprint.</p><p>There are more bacteria in your gut alone than cells in your entire body. This vast bacterial universe contains species that combined can have up to 150 times more genes than exist in humans. Research suggests that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evolution-gut-bacteria-tracks-splits-primate-species">bacteria in our gut</a> predates the appearance of humans and that they may have played an important role in evolutionary separation between our ape ancestors and us.</p><p>Healthy bacteria actively interact with the host immune system in the gut. They contribute to the barrier between <a href="http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v9/n5/full/nri2515.html">disease-causing microorganisms</a> or infections introduced via ingestion. They also help prepare the host immune system to defend the body. The wrong mix of microbes, on the other hand, can contribute to many digestive, immune and mental health disorders and even obesity.</p><p>These tiny organisms work very hard in digestion. They help digest our food and can release nutrients and vitamins essential for our well being, all in exchange for the privilege of existing in a nutritious environment.</p><p>Researchers are actively exploring the many facets of this symbiotic relationship. Recent data show a link between <a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-016-0303-2">gut microbiota diversity</a> and richness and the way we store fat, how we regulate digestion hormones and blood glucose levels, and even what types of food we prefer.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/175427/width754/file-20170623-12617-1xgu8aw.jpg" style="height: 267px; width: 400px;" /></p><figcaption><p>The gut micro biome can influence our cravings for food, including chocolate. <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/melting-chocolate-melted-swirl-stack-chips-540012034?src=LAr1JY4zW1WRgyuRA2Otjg-1-0">beats1/Shutterstock.com</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>This may also be a reason our eating habits are so difficult to change. <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr070431h">Some research</a> suggests that microbiota may generate cravings for foods they specialize in – even <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr070431h">chocolate</a> – or those that will allow them to better compete for resources against other bacteria.</p><p><strong>A three-way call?</strong></p><p>There’s growing evidence of a link between the brain and our microbiota as well. The brain is the equivalent of a computer’s main processor, regulating all physiological variables, including the immune system, the body’s defense against infection and illness.</p><p>All immune cells are “born” in the bone marrow. From our previous research, we knew that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27235450">increased bone marrow inflammation</a>, one of many consequences of high blood pressure, was driven by a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24366083">direct message from the brain</a>. The gut, too, plays an important role in preparing the immune system for battle.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/175428/width754/file-20170623-12620-xe8815.jpg" style="height: 225px; width: 400px;" /></p><figcaption> From deep within our bones, our bone marrow may be communicating with other parts of our bodies. <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/bone-marrow-3d-illustration-451603009?src=_ZTm5qRjDb62KvhATWSHag-1-4">sciencepics/Shutterstock.com</a> </figcaption></figure><p>So we wondered: Could the bone marrow immune cells be playing a role in signaling between the brain and the gut?

 <!--smart_paging_autop_filter--><p>A universe of organisms living inside you may affect every part of your body, from your brain to your bones, and even your thoughts, feelings and your attempts to lose weight.</p><p>This is a universe of trillions of microorganisms – or what we biologists call <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.nature.com/nature/focus/humanmicrobiota/index.html">microbiota</a> – that live in your gut, the part of your body responsible for digestion of the food you eat and the liquids you drink.</p><p>As researchers, we have been looking increasingly into the effect these bacteria have on their host’s body, from obesity to mental illness and heart disease. With obesity, for example, these tiny organisms may play a big role by influencing what foods we crave and how our bodies hold onto fat.</p><p>In a recent study of the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphys.2017.00220/full">gut microbiome</a>, we set out to determine whether the microbiota in the gut can be affected not only by our nervous system but also by an unsuspected source – our bone marrow.</p><p>Our hope is that, by understanding the interactions of the microbiome with other parts of the body, one day treatments could be developed for a range of illnesses.</p><p><strong>The gut-brain-bone marrow connection</strong></p><p>The gut, which includes your esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, colon and other parts of your digestive system, is the first line of defense and the largest interface between the host – in this case, a person – and the outside world.</p><p>After birth, the gut is the first point of entry for environmental and dietary influences on human life. Thus, the microbiota in the gut play a crucial role during human growth, as they contribute to development and maintenance of our immune system throughout our lifetime.</p><p>While we initially thought of the microbiota as relatively simple organisms, the fact is that they may not be so simple after all. Gut microbiota can be as personal and complex as a fingerprint.</p><p>There are more bacteria in your gut alone than cells in your entire body. This vast bacterial universe contains species that combined can have up to 150 times more genes than exist in humans. Research suggests that the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evolution-gut-bacteria-tracks-splits-primate-species">bacteria in our gut</a> predates the appearance of humans and that they may have played an important role in evolutionary separation between our ape ancestors and us.</p><p>Healthy bacteria actively interact with the host immune system in the gut. They contribute to the barrier between <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.nature.com/nri/journal/v9/n5/full/nri2515.html">disease-causing microorganisms</a> or infections introduced via ingestion. They also help prepare the host immune system to defend the body. The wrong mix of microbes, on the other hand, can contribute to many digestive, immune and mental health disorders and even obesity.</p><p>These tiny organisms work very hard in digestion. They help digest our food and can release nutrients and vitamins essential for our well being, all in exchange for the privilege of existing in a nutritious environment.</p><p>Researchers are actively exploring the many facets of this symbiotic relationship. Recent data show a link between <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-016-0303-2">gut microbiota diversity</a> and richness and the way we store fat, how we regulate digestion hormones and blood glucose levels, and even what types of food we prefer.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/175427/width754/file-20170623-12617-1xgu8aw.jpg" style="height: 267px; width: 400px;" /></p><figcaption><p>The gut micro biome can influence our cravings for food, including chocolate. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/melting-chocolate-melted-swirl-stack-chips-540012034?src=LAr1JY4zW1WRgyuRA2Otjg-1-0">beats1/Shutterstock.com</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>This may also be a reason our eating habits are so difficult to change. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr070431h">Some research</a> suggests that microbiota may generate cravings for foods they specialize in – even <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr070431h">chocolate</a> – or those that will allow them to better compete for resources against other bacteria.</p><p><strong>A three-way call?</strong></p><p>There’s growing evidence of a link between the brain and our microbiota as well. The brain is the equivalent of a computer’s main processor, regulating all physiological variables, including the immune system, the body’s defense against infection and illness.</p><p>All immune cells are “born” in the bone marrow. From our previous research, we knew that <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27235450">increased bone marrow inflammation</a>, one of many consequences of high blood pressure, was driven by a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24366083">direct message from the brain</a>. The gut, too, plays an important role in preparing the immune system for battle.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/175428/width754/file-20170623-12620-xe8815.jpg" style="height: 225px; width: 400px;" /></p><figcaption> From deep within our bones, our bone marrow may be communicating with other parts of our bodies. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/bone-marrow-3d-illustration-451603009?src=_ZTm5qRjDb62KvhATWSHag-1-4">sciencepics/Shutterstock.com</a> </figcaption></figure><p>So we wondered: Could the bone marrow immune cells be playing a role in signaling between the brain and the gut?

 <!--smart_paging_autop_filter--><p dir="ltr">Trump’s recent wave of attacks <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/high-anxiety-at-cnn-amid-attacks-from-trump-and-his-trolls">against CNN</a> and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/29/trump-attacks-psycho-joe-scarborough-crazy-mike-brzezinski-in-twitter-tear.html">MSNBC’s Morning Joe</a> are understandably leading to outrage and counterattacks from many in the media, who see it, rightfully, as a dangerous escalation in rhetoric against the press. But despite these condemnations, let us not forget how much of a role these very players had in the rise of President Trump.  </p><p dir="ltr">Let us begin with CNN president Jeff Zucker. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/business/media/jeffrey-zucker-cnn-trump.html">recent profile</a> of Zucker in the New York Times frames the CNN head as a leader in the Trump resistance. The piece begins by painting Zucker as a sleepless muckraker:</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Jeffrey A. Zucker hasn’t been getting a lot of sleep lately. But he says that’s nothing new.</p><p>“I don’t sleep that much anyway,” Mr. Zucker, the president of CNN, said on Wednesday in his fifth-floor office, just off the network’s glassy Midtown Manhattan newsroom.</p><p dir="ltr">A television executive with a reputation for pugilism — a plaque above his desk reads “Punch Today in the Face” — Mr. Zucker, 52, has weathered decades of battles in his industry. But he and CNN are in the middle of their most intense bout yet: an unlikely public fight with the leader of the free world.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Omitted from this profile is a major section of media history that shows Zucker not as a victim, but as someone who just suffered a massive self-inflicted wound.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s no secret that Trump received outsized media coverage early on in the 2016 race, nabbing in 2015 alone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html">nearly $2 billion in free media</a>—much of it from Zucker’s CNN—on his way to securing the Republican nomination. While much of this coverage was negative in tone, there really is no negative coverage. As long as Trump's name remained in the headlines, that’s all that mattered.</p><p dir="ltr">CNN rushed to cover, for months, each and every one of Trump’s manufactured controversies, to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/magazine/cnn-had-a-problem-donald-trump-solved-it.html">tune of record-smashing ratings</a>. CNN even hired Trump aide Corey Lewandowski while he was not only still under contractual agreement not to say anything bad about Trump, but was still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/us/politics/corey-lewandowski-donald-trump-payroll.html">collecting checks</a> from the campaign.</p><p>Aside from raking in record profits riding the Trump spectacle as president of CNN, Zucker’s role in the rise of Trump is far more direct. Before taking over CNN in 2012, while serving as head of NBC Entertainment in 2004, Zucker hired Trump to be the face of the reality show "The Apprentice." The show not only boosted the Trump brand, it almost certainly saved Trump from the brink of financial and marketing extinction.</p><p dir="ltr">As Washington Post’s Margaret Sullivan noted in her <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/jeff-zuckers-singular-role-in-promoting-donald-trumps-rise/2016/10/02/7c3d4366-865b-11e6-a3ef-f35afb41797f_story.html?utm_term=.6955d7229ff6">must-read summation</a> of Zucker’s role in the rise of Trump, Zucker didn’t just help Trump to the White House; he’s probably singlehandedly the person most responsible for doing so:</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Looking for someone specific to hold responsible for the improbable rise of Donald Trump? Although there are many options, you could do worse than to take a hard look at Jeff Zucker, president of CNN Worldwide.</p><p dir="ltr">It was Zucker, after all, who as the new head of NBC Entertainment gave Trump his start in reality TV with “The Apprentice” and then milked the real estate developer’s uncanny knack for success for all it was worth in ratings and profits.</p></blockquote><p>Zucker did so knowing full well Trump’s well-documented record of racism and sexism. Zucker hired Trump long after he <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/653840/donald-trumps-30year-crusade-against-central-park-five">stirred up racist sentiment</a> in New York by calling for the Central Park Five to be executed in a 1989 full-page ad (they were later found innocent of all charges). Zucker let Trump stay on as host of "The Apprentice" long after <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/04/your-lying-eyes/237991/">he repeatedly trafficked</a> in the race-baiting of Obama birtherism; long after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIEbCd7Bixg">he bashed</a> “illegal aliens” on Fox News; long after <a href="http://jezebel.com/5910904/the-only-thing-donald-trump-loves-more-than-money-is-being-a-misogynistic-asshole">he smeared</a> women with sexist insults for decades; and long after <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42762170/ns/politics-more_politics/t/trump-obama-wasnt-qualified-ivy-league/#.VYIFeVVViko">he accused</a> the first African-American president of cheating his way into an Ivy League college.</p><p>Zucker knew he had a racist, sexist demagogue on his hands for years but did nothing; indeed, he actively participated in the horror show, because he was making himself and his corporate buddies millions.</p><p>The glowing New York Times profile failed to mention any of this. The article briefly touches on Zucker’s role in hiring Trump at "The Apprentice," but doesn’t mention his role in covering up and enabling Trump’s bigoted past. It’s not hyperbole to suggest that without Zucker, it’s very likely Trump would be an also-ran on "Dancing with the Stars," not sitting behind a desk at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p><p dir="ltr">Other Trump flacks-turned-#Resistance wannabes include Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the co-hosts of "Morning Joe" on MSNBC. Trump recently lashed out at Brzezinski in a sexist, shocking-even-by-Trump-standards tweet accusing Scarborough and Brzezinski of courting him for an interview at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p dir="ltr">"She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!" Trump tweeted. Immediately, Joe Scarborough fired back, writing an op-ed in the Washington Post titled “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-is-not-well/2017/06/30/97759ee0-5d0f-11e7-9b7d-14576dc0f39d_story.html?utm_term=.57b776d32f29">Trump is Not Well</a>” and sanctimoniously tweeting how Trump was ruining the otherwise noble traditions of the United States.</p><p>The underlying accusation that Scarborough and Brzezinski had courted Trump, if not true in this specific instance, is broadly correct. As with Zucker, Trump was turning on people who had long held him up in order to boost their ratings.</p><p dir="ltr">As Occidental College professor Peter Dreier <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-and-mika-owe-america-an-apology_us_5957408be4b0c85b96c6622a?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004">noted</a> in HuffPo:</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">In late 2015 and 2016, when Trump’s campaign was gaining momentum, [Scarborough and Brzezinski] defended him against his critics and offered him advice. For example, at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York in November 2015, Scarborough proudly recounted how he frequently called Trump to offer political guidance. Returning the bromance favor, in January 2016 Trump talked about Scarborough with Boston talk radio host Howie Carr. “He’s a great guy, and he has a great show ... and we have a lot of fun,” Trump said. After Trump won the New Hampshire primary in February 2016, Trump appeared on “Morning Joe” and told the co-hosts: “You guys have been supporters, and I really appreciate it.”</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Scarborough, and to a lesser extent, Brzezinski, frequently gave Trump sympathetic and often lavishing coverage when they thought him an ally and/or a harmless novelty. Trump’s well-documented racism and sexism were something to be brushed aside and laughed away until that same mean-spirited bile was aimed in their direction. And now they and Zucker want our sympathy? They should get it to the extent no one should be subject to sexist smears, but anything beyond that—any attempt to rebrand them as bold truth-tellers fighting the Trump regime, ought to be dismissed. Those who helped build Donald Trump up cannot be tasked with bringing him down, because, should Trump wake up one day and decide Mika, Jeff and Joe are his friends, there’s nothing in their past to indicate they wouldn’t stop on a dime and happily accept the offer.</p> <!-- iCopyright Interactive Copyright Notice -->

But despite these condemnations, let us not forget how much of a role these very players had in the rise of President Trump.  </p><p dir="ltr">Let us begin with CNN president Jeff Zucker. A <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/business/media/jeffrey-zucker-cnn-trump.html">recent profile</a> of Zucker in the New York Times frames the CNN head as a leader in the Trump resistance. The piece begins by painting Zucker as a sleepless muckraker:</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Jeffrey A. Zucker hasn’t been getting a lot of sleep lately. But he says that’s nothing new.</p><p>“I don’t sleep that much anyway,” Mr. Zucker, the president of CNN, said on Wednesday in his fifth-floor office, just off the network’s glassy Midtown Manhattan newsroom.</p><p dir="ltr">A television executive with a reputation for pugilism — a plaque above his desk reads “Punch Today in the Face” — Mr. Zucker, 52, has weathered decades of battles in his industry. But he and CNN are in the middle of their most intense bout yet: an unlikely public fight with the leader of the free world.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Omitted from this profile is a major section of media history that shows Zucker not as a victim, but as someone who just suffered a massive self-inflicted wound.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s no secret that Trump received outsized media coverage early on in the 2016 race, nabbing in 2015 alone <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html">nearly $2 billion in free media</a>—much of it from Zucker’s CNN—on his way to securing the Republican nomination. While much of this coverage was negative in tone, there really is no negative coverage. As long as Trump&#039;s name remained in the headlines, that’s all that mattered.</p><p dir="ltr">CNN rushed to cover, for months, each and every one of Trump’s manufactured controversies, to the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/magazine/cnn-had-a-problem-donald-trump-solved-it.html">tune of record-smashing ratings</a>. CNN even hired Trump aide Corey Lewandowski while he was not only still under contractual agreement not to say anything bad about Trump, but was still <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/us/politics/corey-lewandowski-donald-trump-payroll.html">collecting checks</a> from the campaign.</p><p>Aside from raking in record profits riding the Trump spectacle as president of CNN, Zucker’s role in the rise of Trump is far more direct.

<!--smart_paging_autop_filter--> <p>Disabled Americans came in wheelchairs into the United States Senate to register their protest against the harsh Republican plan to slash health care. ADAPT, a disability rights group, staged a die-in right before the office of the leading Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. About 60 protesters tried to block the entrance to McConnell’s office. Their goal was to show the rest of America what would come out of the American Health Care Act. which the Republicans sought to push through as an alternative to Obamacare. The police arrested 43 protesters and wheeled out others from McConnell’s hallway. The McConnell plan would slash Medicaid, a government plan that provides health-care coverage for poor Americans and those with disabilities. One of the elements of the plan envisages cutting funds for in-home assistance that allows disabled Americans to remain in their own homes rather than move to nursing homes. Fourteen million Americans will lose any access to health insurance.</p><p>One of the people who got out of her wheelchair to be arrested was Stephanie Woodward, director of advocacy for the Center for Disability Rights. She was arrested by the officers in the Senate, who carried her out. “We have a right to live,” Stephanie Woodward said. “And by live, I don’t mean just breathe. I mean be a part of the American dream, be in the community, raise a family, go to work. These Medicaid cuts will force people into institutions who don’t need to be there.”</p><p><strong>Harsh budget</strong></p><p>Evidence of a major assault by the Trump administration on the social safety net in the U.S. was already there in Trump’s budget proposal. He sought to cut funds for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Medicaid and the Interagency Council on Homelessness. Cuts to affordable housing and to homeless assistance programmes were a centrepiece. But so too are cuts that would hurt the disabled. Sally Johnston, president of the Disabled in Action of Greater Syracuse, said: “Trump’s proposed budget will cut trillions of dollars in domestic services. How can this make America better?”</p><p>Harshness toward the vulnerable defines Trump’s agenda. There was a whisper of this when Trump mocked a disabled reporter for the New York Times, Serge Kovaleski, and when 12-year-old J.J. Holmes, who has cerebral palsy, was ejected from a Trump rally in Tampa, Florida. The disregard shown to people with disabilities reveals the kind of agenda that Trump was always going to drive. Generosity towards people is not his metier. His is a harsh project, to push aside the vulnerable in a social Darwinist drive to excellence. Weakness is reviled. Strength is applauded.</p><p>In late June, Trump’s Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin married the Scottish actress Louise Linton. They had a lavish wedding, attended by Trump, his Vice President and most of the Cabinet. Mnuchin and Louise Linton live in a $12.6 million home in an exclusive part of Washington, D.C. The money is Mnuchin’s, what he made as a partner in Goldman Sachs. Mnuchin is not the only fabulously wealthy person in Trump’s cabinet. He sits at Cabinet meetings near Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Deputy Commerce Secretary Todd Ricketts. Trump’s Chief Economic Adviser is Gary Cohn, another former Goldman Sachs president. All are worth hundreds of millions of dollars each.</p><p>At a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, just after the Mnuchin wedding, Trump mused about the wealth in his Cabinet. “Somebody said—why did you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy? No, it’s true. And Wilbur’s a very rich person in charge of commerce. I said—Because that’s the kind of thinking we want’.” What kind of thinking would that be? The thinking of someone who was willing to set aside any social agenda for his individual gain.</p><p>Trump’s base is made of a combination of people of great wealth—who are few—and the immense white-collar middle-class sector that has found itself made vulnerable by globalisation. Business process outsourcing struck the white-collar middle class, which formed the base of the Tea Party and then the Trump movement. He promised this base that he would not become wedded to Wall Street but would put Main Street in charge. That has not come to pass. “I love all people, rich or poor,” Trump said, “but in those particular positions I don’t want a poor person.” No poor or middle-class person should direct commercial or budgetary policy. That should be left to the rich. This is an honest assessment of Trump’s project—to appeal to the mass of white-collar vulnerable workers, but to deliver the reins of power to the very wealthy.</p><p>In a new book, Duke University professor Nancy MacLean goes into the intellectual roots of the radical Right and the vision of the current agenda, as articulated by Trump. The Right, she shows in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1101980966/counterpunchmaga">Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of The Radical Right’s Stealth Plan for America</a>, is interested in the destruction of “society” and the creation of pure individualism. Charles Koch, one of the major financiers of the radical Right, relied upon Baldy Harper. Harper argued, decades ago, that support for vulnerable populations would erode liberty. He suggested that liberal policies that helped the poor and the disadvantaged would be like a disease against society. “Once the disease has advanced,” he wrote, “a bitter curative medicine is required to gain already-lost liberty.” These are harsh words. The idea of a “bitter curative medicine” is something that is natural to the Trump team. The vicious knives they wield against any social policy for the poor and the vulnerable are sharp and are used with gusto. One can see the way they cut away at precious social policies in the budget and in their health care plans.</p><p>Nancy MacLean describes the agenda of the economist James Buchanan, who won the Nobel Prize for Economics. Buchanan is a favourite of the radical Right, for whom he acts as an important intellectual standard. A clear sentiment of Buchanan’s vision is available in a 2005 document, where he attacks people who have not been able to save enough for unforeseen circumstances or for retirement. If they fall catastrophically ill or lose their jobs, they should have prepared for this eventuality through prudent savings. If not, Buchanan wrote, they “are to be treated as subordinate members of the species, akin to animals who are dependent”. The language here is ferocious. It is mimicked by Trump and his Cabinet.</p><p>Let us return to Trump’s budget. He proposes to cut $2.5 trillion in programmes for the working class and the indigent. Food stamps, the essential means for the poorest Americans to access food, would go. It is important to underline that one in six Americans struggles with hunger—49 million Americans have a hard time putting food on their tables. One in five children is at risk of hunger, with the ratio higher—one in three—for African-American and Latino families. There will be no easy way for Americans who struggle with food insecurity to feed themselves. They will be left to starve, like “subordinate members of the species”.</p><p><strong>‘Poverty a state of mind’</strong></p><p>In a radio interview, Trump’s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson said: “I think poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind.” Aid to the poor, says the Trump team, does not work. The poor must be made to “go to work”, said Trump’s Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. But how to go to work when jobs are simply unavailable, as Trump himself has said on many occasions? In fact, the office that helps the poor find jobs has also been slated to be cut. That means even those few programmes to assist the unemployed to find work will no longer be available. In fact, as New York University Professor Jonathan Morduch and Rachael Schneider say in their new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691172986/counterpunchmaga">The Financial Diaries: How American Families Cope in a World of Uncertainty</a>, even those who have jobs at low pay struggle to make ends meet. Many of them rely on government assistance to get by. If they do not get access to government programmes, they turn to credit card loans and payday loans to cover their bills. There is great fragility in the budgets of the working poor.</p><p>There is cruelty in Trump’s vision. It throws the poor to the lions of desperation. The remnants of liberalism are being withdrawn. This is the end of the social contract.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared in Frontline (India).</em></p> &nbsp;<h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/trumps-loyalty-fixation-recalls-one-uss-most-disastrous-presidencies">Trump&#039;s Loyalty Fixation Recalls One of the US&#039;s Most Disastrous Presidencies</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/why-trumps-warsaw-speech-may-have-been-his-most-ominous-yet">Why Trump&#039;s Warsaw Speech May Have Been His Most Ominous Yet</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/why-we-need-left-wing-critique-liberalism-because-liberals-got-us-where-we-are">Lefties Criticizing Liberals for Helping Get Us Into This Mess</a></li></ul>

<!--smart_paging_autop_filter--> <p>Disabled Americans came in wheelchairs into the United States Senate to register their protest against the harsh Republican plan to slash health care. ADAPT, a disability rights group, staged a die-in right before the office of the leading Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. About 60 protesters tried to block the entrance to McConnell’s office. Their goal was to show the rest of America what would come out of the American Health Care Act. which the Republicans sought to push through as an alternative to Obamacare. The police arrested 43 protesters and wheeled out others from McConnell’s hallway. The McConnell plan would slash Medicaid, a government plan that provides health-care coverage for poor Americans and those with disabilities. One of the elements of the plan envisages cutting funds for in-home assistance that allows disabled Americans to remain in their own homes rather than move to nursing homes. Fourteen million Americans will lose any access to health insurance.</p><p>One of the people who got out of her wheelchair to be arrested was Stephanie Woodward, director of advocacy for the Center for Disability Rights. She was arrested by the officers in the Senate, who carried her out. “We have a right to live,” Stephanie Woodward said. “And by live, I don’t mean just breathe. I mean be a part of the American dream, be in the community, raise a family, go to work. These Medicaid cuts will force people into institutions who don’t need to be there.”</p><p><strong>Harsh budget</strong></p><p>Evidence of a major assault by the Trump administration on the social safety net in the U.S. was already there in Trump’s budget proposal. He sought to cut funds for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Medicaid and the Interagency Council on Homelessness. Cuts to affordable housing and to homeless assistance programmes were a centrepiece. But so too are cuts that would hurt the disabled. Sally Johnston, president of the Disabled in Action of Greater Syracuse, said: “Trump’s proposed budget will cut trillions of dollars in domestic services. How can this make America better?”</p><p>Harshness toward the vulnerable defines Trump’s agenda. There was a whisper of this when Trump mocked a disabled reporter for the New York Times, Serge Kovaleski, and when 12-year-old J.J. Holmes, who has cerebral palsy, was ejected from a Trump rally in Tampa, Florida. The disregard shown to people with disabilities reveals the kind of agenda that Trump was always going to drive. Generosity towards people is not his metier. His is a harsh project, to push aside the vulnerable in a social Darwinist drive to excellence. Weakness is reviled. Strength is applauded.</p><p>In late June, Trump’s Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin married the Scottish actress Louise Linton. They had a lavish wedding, attended by Trump, his Vice President and most of the Cabinet. Mnuchin and Louise Linton live in a $12.6 million home in an exclusive part of Washington, D.C. The money is Mnuchin’s, what he made as a partner in Goldman Sachs. Mnuchin is not the only fabulously wealthy person in Trump’s cabinet. He sits at Cabinet meetings near Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Deputy Commerce Secretary Todd Ricketts. Trump’s Chief Economic Adviser is Gary Cohn, another former Goldman Sachs president. All are worth hundreds of millions of dollars each.</p><p>At a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, just after the Mnuchin wedding, Trump mused about the wealth in his Cabinet. “Somebody said—why did you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy? No, it’s true. And Wilbur’s a very rich person in charge of commerce. I said—Because that’s the kind of thinking we want’.” What kind of thinking would that be? The thinking of someone who was willing to set aside any social agenda for his individual gain.</p><p>Trump’s base is made of a combination of people of great wealth—who are few—and the immense white-collar middle-class sector that has found itself made vulnerable by globalisation. Business process outsourcing struck the white-collar middle class, which formed the base of the Tea Party and then the Trump movement. He promised this base that he would not become wedded to Wall Street but would put Main Street in charge. That has not come to pass. “I love all people, rich or poor,” Trump said, “but in those particular positions I don’t want a poor person.” No poor or middle-class person should direct commercial or budgetary policy. That should be left to the rich. This is an honest assessment of Trump’s project—to appeal to the mass of white-collar vulnerable workers, but to deliver the reins of power to the very wealthy.</p><p>In a new book, Duke University professor Nancy MacLean goes into the intellectual roots of the radical Right and the vision of the current agenda, as articulated by Trump. The Right, she shows in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1101980966/counterpunchmaga">Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of The Radical Right’s Stealth Plan for America</a>, is interested in the destruction of “society” and the creation of pure individualism. Charles Koch, one of the major financiers of the radical Right, relied upon Baldy Harper. Harper argued, decades ago, that support for vulnerable populations would erode liberty. He suggested that liberal policies that helped the poor and the disadvantaged would be like a disease against society. “Once the disease has advanced,” he wrote, “a bitter curative medicine is required to gain already-lost liberty.” These are harsh words. The idea of a “bitter curative medicine” is something that is natural to the Trump team. The vicious knives they wield against any social policy for the poor and the vulnerable are sharp and are used with gusto. One can see the way they cut away at precious social policies in the budget and in their health care plans.</p><p>Nancy MacLean describes the agenda of the economist James Buchanan, who won the Nobel Prize for Economics. Buchanan is a favourite of the radical Right, for whom he acts as an important intellectual standard. A clear sentiment of Buchanan’s vision is available in a 2005 document, where he attacks people who have not been able to save enough for unforeseen circumstances or for retirement. If they fall catastrophically ill or lose their jobs, they should have prepared for this eventuality through prudent savings. If not, Buchanan wrote, they “are to be treated as subordinate members of the species, akin to animals who are dependent”. The language here is ferocious. It is mimicked by Trump and his Cabinet.</p><p>Let us return to Trump’s budget. He proposes to cut $2.5 trillion in programmes for the working class and the indigent. Food stamps, the essential means for the poorest Americans to access food, would go. It is important to underline that one in six Americans struggles with hunger—49 million Americans have a hard time putting food on their tables. One in five children is at risk of hunger, with the ratio higher—one in three—for African-American and Latino families. There will be no easy way for Americans who struggle with food insecurity to feed themselves. They will be left to starve, like “subordinate members of the species”.</p><p><strong>‘Poverty a state of mind’</strong></p><p>In a radio interview, Trump’s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson said: “I think poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind.” Aid to the poor, says the Trump team, does not work. The poor must be made to “go to work”, said Trump’s Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. But how to go to work when jobs are simply unavailable, as Trump himself has said on many occasions? In fact, the office that helps the poor find jobs has also been slated to be cut. That means even those few programmes to assist the unemployed to find work will no longer be available. In fact, as New York University Professor Jonathan Morduch and Rachael Schneider say in their new book <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691172986/counterpunchmaga">The Financial Diaries: How American Families Cope in a World of Uncertainty</a>, even those who have jobs at low pay struggle to make ends meet. Many of them rely on government assistance to get by. If they do not get access to government programmes, they turn to credit card loans and payday loans to cover their bills. There is great fragility in the budgets of the working poor.</p><p>There is cruelty in Trump’s vision. It throws the poor to the lions of desperation. The remnants of liberalism are being withdrawn. This is the end of the social contract.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared in Frontline (India).</em></p> <Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" alt="" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/392085606/0/alternet">

 <!--smart_paging_autop_filter--><p>No doubt, there are historians who are already willing to call Donald Trump the worst president in history. It is hard to imagine how, in such a short time, an elected president could reveal how truly bad he is; how ignorant, insensitive, mendacious, dysfunctional, self-centered, and at times borderline psychotic. But all this may add up to more than just "worst president." Trump may be the worst human being alive—the most hated person in America and throughout the world today.</p><p dir="ltr">How do you decide whether someone is the worst person alive? You probably include in your criteria stupid behavior, lies and cheating, lack of grace and charm, cruelty, obsession with revenge, and constantly putting other people down—the weaker the better. But it's also important to check in on public opinion, or rather media opinion, to contextualize Trump's horrific standing.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/most-hated-people-2017.html/?a=viewall">TV Cheat Sheet</a> likes to keep track of all the truly unpopular people, and it has dubbed Donald Trump the "most hated person in 2017" so far. Trump was also number one in 2016, which kind of says it all.</p><p>Trump's most serious competition for most hated person alive is Martin Shkreli, who is high on most lists of people the public loathes. Shkreli, the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, earned the ire of millions of Americans by hiking the price for the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by 5,000 percent. He was also <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/controversial-pharmaceutical-ceo-martin-shkreli-arrested-for-fraud-20151217">arrested for fraud</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The two other people who consistently rate high on the TV Cheat Sheet hate-o-meter, perhaps offering Trump some competition, are Kim Jong-un and Justin Bieber. Kim is "<a href="http://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/hated-people-of-2016.html/?a=viewall">North Korea’s</a> supreme leader, a petty dictator who is more concerned with being feared on the international stage than fixing the horrid living conditions of his country’s citizens," while Bieber has had "a string of bad actions and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/places-justin-bieber-trouble/story?id=22297004">public controversies</a> in recent years, including vandalism, driving under the influence, resisting arrest and taking prescription drugs." </p><p>Others who find their way onto various most-hated lists are child molester Jared Fogle, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian (both as a couple and when measured separately), O.J. Simpson, Casey Anthony, Bernie Madoff, Michael Moore, Mel Gibson, and Tiger Woods.</p><p dir="ltr">And some of the worst dead people in history consistently show up on these kinds of lists: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Osama bin Laden to name a few.</p><p dir="ltr">In the end, Trump triumphs as the most despised man alive today in America, and probably the world.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to show all the ways in which Trump earns this top spot, we offer the following colorful, often brilliant and truly depressing descriptions of Trump, composed by a range of experts and writers who have piercingly observed the U.S.'s 45th and very worst president.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>We Let the Experts Speak</strong></p><p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.alternet.org/culture/july-fourth-message-patriots">Joe Conason, AlterNet</a>: </strong>Most Americans despise the president—a blustering, feckless lout who ignores [the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution]... as he undermines freedom of the press and the free exercise of religion. He has appointed a government of plutocrats, mostly mirroring his own unfitness for office, who appear determined to dismantle the institutions that have made this country humane, strong, prosperous, and respected. Along with his political associates and members of his family, he has encouraged and emboldened the very worst elements in American politics, including so-called white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and neo-Confederates, all echoing his promise to “Make America Great Again.” They cannot make America great again.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>2. <a href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/trump-and-allies-its-fk-you-presidency">Kali Holloway, AlterNet</a>: </strong>Trump’s presidency is what happens when you elect a vengeful man-baby with an insatiable lust for power, a desperate need for attention, and endless reserves of contempt for the masses. Instead of accountability or transparency, ideas or innovation, you get a commander-in-chief whose most salient traits are narcissistic self-interest, hypersensitivity to criticism and a knee-jerk tendency toward abuse. Question the job Trump is doing and instead of a vigorous defense of his policies or proposals you’ll get a hastily worded middle finger. Who are you to question me, the president? Trump seems to be saying: You’re nobody.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>3. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/roger-cohen">Roger Cohen</a>, <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/opinion/the-trump-possibility.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Froger-cohen&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=52&amp;pgtype=collection">New York Times</a></em></strong>: Donald Trump is a thug. He’s a thug who talks gibberish, and lies, and cheats, and has issues, to put it mildly, with women. He’s lazy and limited and he has an attention span of a nanosecond. He’s a "gene believer" who thinks he has "great genes" and considers the German blood, of which he is proud, "great stuff." Mexicans and Muslims, by contrast, don’t make the cut.  </p><p dir="ltr">He’s managed to bring penis size and menstrual cycles and the eating habits of a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/opinion/alicia-machado-vs-donald-trumps-machismo.html">former Miss Universe</a> into the debate for the highest office in the land. He’s mocked and mimicked the handicapped and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-imitates-clinton-stumbling-while-ill-with-pneumonia/2016/10/02/e5dce8d4-8887-11e6-8cdc-4fbb1973b506_video.html">pneumonia-induced malaise</a> of Hillary Clinton. His intellectual interests would not fill a safe-deposit box at Trump Tower. There’s more ingenuity to his hairstyle than any of his rambling pronouncements. His political hero is Vladimir Putin, who has perfected what John le Carré once called the "classic, timeless, all-Russian, bare-faced whopping lie."</p><p>This is a man who likes to strut and gloat. He’s such a great businessman he declared a loss of $916 million on his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html">1995 tax return</a>, a loss so huge the tax software program used by his accountant choked at the amount, which had to be added manually. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Roger Cohen in a <a href="http://https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/opinion/donald-trump-2020-roger-cohen.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Frogercohen&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=0">later column</a>, 'Trump 2020 Is No Joke': </strong>Trumpism is a form of collective gaslighting at Twitter speed. It is founded on the principle that velocity trumps veracity — perfect for the president’s manic personality. It reflects the president’s intuitive sense—through his own acute experience — of limited attention spans. It seeks to achieve dominance through a whirlwind of individually meaningless but cumulatively manipulative statements.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>4. <a href="http://www.theroot.com/y-all-s-president-is-a-lazy-thot-1792441576">Michael Arceneaux, The Root</a>: </strong>Y’all’s president is one vacationing-ass bitch. It hasn’t even been a smooth full month into Tropicana Jong-il’s four-year term (insert laugh track here), and the man has taken every weekend off. To his credit, much like his racism, his xenophobia, his sexism, his narcissism, his creepy obsession with his daughter and his insecurities, 45 has not been shy about sharing his laziness with the world. [...] 1) This man is not very interested in being president other than in the title; 2) he is taking advantage of U.S. taxpayers by going to the resort he owns every single weekend; and, most important, 3) he is a lazy piece of shit.</p><p><strong>5. <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/2017/07/brutal-australian-journalist-sums-trumps?utm_source=fark&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=im">ABC political editor Chris Uhlmann</a>, as described by Bronte Coy at <a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/president-donald-trump-skewered-as-friendless-and-awkward-in-viral-takedown/news-story/cd92a7a425e8126e01b9c5bdb9143688">News.com.au</a>: </strong>ABC’s political editor Chris Uhlmann didn’t pull any punches when he delivered his wrap-up of Trump’s appearance at the conference, calling him an “uneasy, lonely, awkward figure” who was left “isolated and friendless” with “no desire and no capacity to lead the world.” </p><p dir="ltr">“He has a particular skill set: he’s identified an illness in Western democracies, but he has no cure for it and seems intent on exploiting it,” the veteran journalist said.</p><p dir="ltr">And according to Uhlmann, we all need to give up on any hope that the speeches written for Trump and delivered by the man himself are any reflection of his true thoughts.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s the unscripted Trump that’s real: a man who barks out bile in 140 characters, who wastes his precious days as President at war with the West’s institutions like the judiciary, independent government agencies, and the free press.”</p><p dir="ltr">The reporter added: “Mr Trump is a man who craves power because it burnishes his celebrity. To be constantly talking and talked about is all that really matters... and there is no value placed on the meaning of words, so what is said one day can be discarded the next.”</p><p><em>Watch the two-minute video of Chris Uhlmann</em>:</p><p dir="ltr"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u8iXK2_U4IM" width="640"></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>6. <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/28/donald-trump-is-americas-experiment-in-having-no-government/">Rosa Brooks, Foreign Policy</a>:</strong> In his 1973 classic, <em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</em>, economist Burton Malkiel famously argued that “A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper’s financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts.” ... In our new national science experiment, we’re now embarking on a four-year, uncontrolled experiment in whether the same principle applies to governing. Just as child labor laws (for now!) prevent us from placing a 9-year-old in the Oval Office, ethical concerns about the treatment of animals prevent us from literally installing a blindfolded monkey in the White House. With Donald Trump making decisions, however, we’ve got the next best thing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>7. David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, in his foreword to Mark Singer’s 2016 book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trump-Me-Mark-Singer/dp/0451498593/?tag=alternorg08-20">Trump and Me</a>: </strong>This was a gentleman who went on the radio to say of his former wife, “Nice tits, no brains.” His vulgarity was unstoppable and without limit. He didn’t much care if it came off a little crude. He knew you couldn’t resist listening. “You know," he said, “it doesn’t really matter what they write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.” Not only was Trump beyond insult or parody, he seemed a distinctly local product, like the smell of a Times Square subway platform in mid-August. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>8. <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/16/donald-trump-is-proving-too-stupid-to-be-president/">Max Boot, Foreign Policy</a>: </strong>More broadly, Trump has had a lifetime — 71 years — and access to America’s finest educational institutions (he’s a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, he never tires of reminding us) to learn things. And yet he doesn’t seem to have acquired even the most basic information that a high school student should possess.</p><p dir="ltr">Why does he know so little? Because he doesn’t read books or even long articles. “I never have,” he proudly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-doesnt-read-much-being-president-probably-wouldnt-change-that/2016/07/17/d2ddf2bc-4932-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html?utm_term=.12ccfea271bb">told</a> a reporter last year. “I’m always busy doing a lot.” As president, Trump’s intelligence briefings have been <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/classified-memo-tells-intelligence-analysts-keep-trumps-daily-brief-short">dumbed down</a>, denuded of nuance, and larded with maps and pictures because he can’t be bothered to read a lot of words. He’d rather play golf.</p><p dir="ltr">The surest indication of how not smart Trump is that he thinks his inability or lack of interest in acquiring knowledge doesn’t matter. He <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-doesnt-read-much-being-president-probably-wouldnt-change-that/2016/07/17/d2ddf2bc-4932-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html?utm_term=.34a89df03670">said</a> last year that he reaches the right decisions “with very little knowledge other than the knowledge I [already] had, plus the words ‘common sense,’ because I have a lot of common sense and I have a lot of business ability.” </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>9. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pg7xqz/above-all-trump-is-just-really-dumb">Eve Peyser, Vice</a>: </strong>Trump's impulsive recklessness, his pathological need to impress, is his defining characteristic. As New York magazine's Olivia Nuzzi <a href="https://twitter.com/olivianuzzi/status/864231596932698116">remarked</a> on Twitter, "President Trump once read a senator's cell phone number aloud just to fuck with him. Of course he can't keep classified info to himself."</p><p dir="ltr">We're dealing with a man who literally thinks exercising too much <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/08/how-trump-could-get-fired">is bad</a> because your body has a finite amount of energy. He told the Economist that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/upshot/priming-the-pump-the-economic-metaphor-trump-thinks-he-invented.html">invented</a> the very common expression "priming the pump," which would be sort of funny if he was joking. What does Russia "have" on Donald Trump? The same thing everyone does: Trump is stupid. </p><p><strong>10. Cornell West to Amy Goodman on <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2016/12/1/cornel_west_on_donald_trump_this">Democracy Now!</a>: </strong>Now you get someone who’s narcissistic, which is to say out of control psychologically, who is ideologically confused, which is to say in over his head. And who does he choose? The most right-wing, reactionary zealots, which lead toward the arbitrary deployment of law, which is what neofascism is, but to reinforce corporate interest, big bank interest, and to keep track of those of us who are cast as other—peoples of color, women, Jews, Arabs, Muslims, Mexicans and so forth and so on. So this is one of the most frightening moments in the history of this very fragile empire and fragile republic. </p><p><strong>11. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/05/31/trump-might-be-the-dimmest-president-ever/?utm_term=.f325eae73ab3">Jennifer Rubin, Washington Post</a>: </strong>Whatever the explanation, Trump does not evidence any greater knowledge or sophistication than he possessed when he entered office. You’d think he would have learned something in four months. Then again, maybe the rudimentary practices of government are simply beyond him. One need not be a psychiatrist nor an educator to see that he is incapable of performing the functions of his job — executing the laws, keeping the nation’s secrets, following routine security procedures. In short, maybe he is not compromised nor mentally ill, but simply dumb. </p><p><strong>12. <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/06/just-how-bad-are-things-really-for-donald-trump/">Paul Wood, The Spectator</a>: </strong>Unflattering stories in the U.S. media portray Trump as behaving like, well, Trump. The President is served Diet Coke at lunch while his guests get only water; the President gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream, his guests one. My sources say the President often fails to attend his daily intelligence briefing; when he does, his attention span is disastrously short; he’ll read only documents a page or two long which "must have pictures." Some believe Twitter’s time stamps even show him tweeting during these briefings.</p><p>A regular visitor to the White House told me that leaks about the President shouting at his senior staff were true. "The White House is not a happy place." Television images show Trump getting to the lectern in the West Wing to make an announcement, then forgetting to make it and walking out; Trump’s critics paint a picture of the President as rambling, confused, irritable and prone to tantrums: the madness of King Donald.<br /><br />Some of those critics have an explanation for this: not porphyria — the "blue urine" disease that afflicted George III — but dementia. One of the TV news shows that so infuriates the President, MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," devoted a whole segment to this. The host, Joe Scarborough, compared a "mumbling and incoherent" Trump to his aged mother who had dementia — though, he said: "We’re not diagnosing anything."</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>13. <a href="http://billmoyers.com/story/president-trump-impeachment/">Michael Winship, BillMoyers.com</a>: </strong>A tune was running through my head...the opening number from the 1980 musical <a href="http://stageagent.com/shows/musical/1466/barnum">Barnum</a>, that glorified the master showman....P.T. Barnum....[T]hat show is long overdue for a revival, although it easily can be argued that there’s no need — P.T. Barnum is alive and well and living in the White House.</p><p dir="ltr">Donald Trump is the con man huckster of all time, and in his sway are the many descendants of those suckers who back in the day provided a steady livelihood for good old P.T. There are differences....But the similarities are there for sure — each man endeavoring to create sideshows that fool both the public and the media with clever tricks that distract the eye. Barnum did it for fun and profit; Trump out of malice, a desperate need for attention and most important to the country, the desire to divert attention from the fact that in less than six months his administration has flamed out in many spectacular ways, while at the same time effectively wrought havoc with representative democracy and government.</p><p dir="ltr">Subverting rules and regulations, upending international agreements and offending other countries while backslapping right-wing nationalists, sending the justice system hurtling back toward the 19th century, enabling the very rich (including himself) to get much, much richer and the poor to fall through the safety net (the Trumpcare debacle) — what we’ve seen in such a short time is a brutish, conscious effort to subvert the inalienable rights both guaranteed and implied by the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>14. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all">Tony Schwartz</a>, ghostwriter of Trump’s autobiography, <em>The Art of the Deal</em>, talking to The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer last July after Trump announced his run for the presidency: </strong>“I put lipstick on a pig,” [Schwartz] said. “I feel a deep sense of remorse that I contributed to presenting Trump in a way that brought him wider attention and made him more appealing than he is.” He went on, “I genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.” If he were writing <em>The Art of the Deal</em> today, Schwartz said, it would be a very different book with a very different title. Asked what he would call it, he answered, “The Sociopath.”</p> <!-- iCopyright Interactive Copyright Notice -->

 <!--smart_paging_autop_filter--><p>No doubt, there are historians who are already willing to call Donald Trump the worst president in history. It is hard to imagine how, in such a short time, an elected president could reveal how truly bad he is; how ignorant, insensitive, mendacious, dysfunctional, self-centered, and at times borderline psychotic. But all this may add up to more than just "worst president." Trump may be the worst human being alive—the most hated person in America and throughout the world today.</p><p dir="ltr">How do you decide whether someone is the worst person alive? You probably include in your criteria stupid behavior, lies and cheating, lack of grace and charm, cruelty, obsession with revenge, and constantly putting other people down—the weaker the better. But it&#039;s also important to check in on public opinion, or rather media opinion, to contextualize Trump&#039;s horrific standing.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/most-hated-people-2017.html/?a=viewall">TV Cheat Sheet</a> likes to keep track of all the truly unpopular people, and it has dubbed Donald Trump the "most hated person in 2017" so far. Trump was also number one in 2016, which kind of says it all.</p><p>Trump&#039;s most serious competition for most hated person alive is Martin Shkreli, who is high on most lists of people the public loathes. Shkreli, the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, earned the ire of millions of Americans by hiking the price for the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by 5,000 percent. He was also <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/controversial-pharmaceutical-ceo-martin-shkreli-arrested-for-fraud-20151217">arrested for fraud</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The two other people who consistently rate high on the TV Cheat Sheet hate-o-meter, perhaps offering Trump some competition, are Kim Jong-un and Justin Bieber. Kim is "<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/hated-people-of-2016.html/?a=viewall">North Korea’s</a> supreme leader, a petty dictator who is more concerned with being feared on the international stage than fixing the horrid living conditions of his country’s citizens," while Bieber has had "a string of bad actions and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/places-justin-bieber-trouble/story?id=22297004">public controversies</a> in recent years, including vandalism, driving under the influence, resisting arrest and taking prescription drugs." </p><p>Others who find their way onto various most-hated lists are child molester Jared Fogle, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian (both as a couple and when measured separately), O.J. Simpson, Casey Anthony, Bernie Madoff, Michael Moore, Mel Gibson, and Tiger Woods.</p><p dir="ltr">And some of the worst dead people in history consistently show up on these kinds of lists: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Osama bin Laden to name a few.</p><p dir="ltr">In the end, Trump triumphs as the most despised man alive today in America, and probably the world.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to show all the ways in which Trump earns this top spot, we offer the following colorful, often brilliant and truly depressing descriptions of Trump, composed by a range of experts and writers who have piercingly observed the U.S.&#039;s 45th and very worst president.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>We Let the Experts Speak</strong></p><p><strong>1. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.alternet.org/culture/july-fourth-message-patriots">Joe Conason, AlterNet</a>: </strong>Most Americans despise the president—a blustering, feckless lout who ignores [the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution]... as he undermines freedom of the press and the free exercise of religion. He has appointed a government of plutocrats, mostly mirroring his own unfitness for office, who appear determined to dismantle the institutions that have made this country humane, strong, prosperous, and respected. Along with his political associates and members of his family, he has encouraged and emboldened the very worst elements in American politics, including so-called white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and neo-Confederates, all echoing his promise to “Make America Great Again.” They cannot make America great again.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>2. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/trump-and-allies-its-fk-you-presidency">Kali Holloway, AlterNet</a>: </strong>Trump’s presidency is what happens when you elect a vengeful man-baby with an insatiable lust for power, a desperate need for attention, and endless reserves of contempt for the masses. Instead of accountability or transparency, ideas or innovation, you get a commander-in-chief whose most salient traits are narcissistic self-interest, hypersensitivity to criticism and a knee-jerk tendency toward abuse. Question the job Trump is doing and instead of a vigorous defense of his policies or proposals you’ll get a hastily worded middle finger. Who are you to question me, the president? Trump seems to be saying: You’re nobody.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>3. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.nytimes.com/column/roger-cohen">Roger Cohen</a>, <em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/opinion/the-trump-possibility.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Froger-cohen&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=52&amp;pgtype=collection">New York Times</a></em></strong>: Donald Trump is a thug. He’s a thug who talks gibberish, and lies, and cheats, and has issues, to put it mildly, with women. He’s lazy and limited and he has an attention span of a nanosecond. He’s a "gene believer" who thinks he has "great genes" and considers the German blood, of which he is proud, "great stuff." Mexicans and Muslims, by contrast, don’t make the cut.  </p><p dir="ltr">He’s managed to bring penis size and menstrual cycles and the eating habits of a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/opinion/alicia-machado-vs-donald-trumps-machismo.html">former Miss Universe</a> into the debate for the highest office in the land.

His intellectual interests would not fill a safe-deposit box at Trump Tower. There’s more ingenuity to his hairstyle than any of his rambling pronouncements. His political hero is Vladimir Putin, who has perfected what John le Carré once called the "classic, timeless, all-Russian, bare-faced whopping lie."</p><p>This is a man who likes to strut and gloat. He’s such a great businessman he declared a loss of $916 million on his <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html">1995 tax return</a>, a loss so huge the tax software program used by his accountant choked at the amount, which had to be added manually. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Roger Cohen in a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/opinion/donald-trump-2020-roger-cohen.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Frogercohen&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=0">later column</a>, &#039;Trump 2020 Is No Joke&#039;: </strong>Trumpism is a form of collective gaslighting at Twitter speed. It is founded on the principle that velocity trumps veracity — perfect for the president’s manic personality. It reflects the president’s intuitive sense—through his own acute experience — of limited attention spans. It seeks to achieve dominance through a whirlwind of individually meaningless but cumulatively manipulative statements.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>4. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.theroot.com/y-all-s-president-is-a-lazy-thot-1792441576">Michael Arceneaux, The Root</a>: </strong>Y’all’s president is one vacationing-ass bitch. It hasn’t even been a smooth full month into Tropicana Jong-il’s four-year term (insert laugh track here), and the man has taken every weekend off. To his credit, much like his racism, his xenophobia, his sexism, his narcissism, his creepy obsession with his daughter and his insecurities, 45 has not been shy about sharing his laziness with the world. [...] 1) This man is not very interested in being president other than in the title; 2) he is taking advantage of U.S. taxpayers by going to the resort he owns every single weekend; and, most important, 3) he is a lazy piece of shit.</p><p><strong>5. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~crooksandliars.com/2017/07/brutal-australian-journalist-sums-trumps?utm_source=fark&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=im">ABC political editor Chris Uhlmann</a>, as described by Bronte Coy at <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/president-donald-trump-skewered-as-friendless-and-awkward-in-viral-takedown/news-story/cd92a7a425e8126e01b9c5bdb9143688">News.com.au</a>: </strong>ABC’s political editor Chris Uhlmann didn’t pull any punches when he delivered his wrap-up of Trump’s appearance at the conference, calling him an “uneasy, lonely, awkward figure” who was left “isolated and friendless” with “no desire and no capacity to lead the world.” </p><p dir="ltr">“He has a particular skill set: he’s identified an illness in Western democracies, but he has no cure for it and seems intent on exploiting it,” the veteran journalist said.</p><p dir="ltr">And according to Uhlmann, we all need to give up on any hope that the speeches written for Trump and delivered by the man himself are any reflection of his true thoughts.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s the unscripted Trump that’s real: a man who barks out bile in 140 characters, who wastes his precious days as President at war with the West’s institutions like the judiciary, independent government agencies, and the free press.”</p><p dir="ltr">The reporter added: “Mr Trump is a man who craves power because it burnishes his celebrity. To be constantly talking and talked about is all that really matters... and there is no value placed on the meaning of words, so what is said one day can be discarded the next.”</p><p><em>Watch the two-minute video of Chris Uhlmann</em>:</p><p dir="ltr"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u8iXK2_U4IM" width="640"></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>6. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/28/donald-trump-is-americas-experiment-in-having-no-government/">Rosa Brooks, Foreign Policy</a>:</strong> In his 1973 classic, <em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</em>, economist Burton Malkiel famously argued that “A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper’s financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts.” ... In our new national science experiment, we’re now embarking on a four-year, uncontrolled experiment in whether the same principle applies to governing. Just as child labor laws (for now!) prevent us from placing a 9-year-old in the Oval Office, ethical concerns about the treatment of animals prevent us from literally installing a blindfolded monkey in the White House. With Donald Trump making decisions, however, we’ve got the next best thing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>7.

He didn’t much care if it came off a little crude. He knew you couldn’t resist listening. “You know," he said, “it doesn’t really matter what they write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.” Not only was Trump beyond insult or parody, he seemed a distinctly local product, like the smell of a Times Square subway platform in mid-August. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>8. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/16/donald-trump-is-proving-too-stupid-to-be-president/">Max Boot, Foreign Policy</a>: </strong>More broadly, Trump has had a lifetime — 71 years — and access to America’s finest educational institutions (he’s a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, he never tires of reminding us) to learn things. And yet he doesn’t seem to have acquired even the most basic information that a high school student should possess.</p><p dir="ltr">Why does he know so little?

As New York magazine&#039;s Olivia Nuzzi <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://twitter.com/olivianuzzi/status/864231596932698116">remarked</a> on Twitter, "President Trump once read a senator&#039;s cell phone number aloud just to fuck with him.

What does Russia "have" on Donald Trump? The same thing everyone does: Trump is stupid. </p><p><strong>10. Cornell West to Amy Goodman on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.democracynow.org/2016/12/1/cornel_west_on_donald_trump_this">Democracy Now!</a>: </strong>Now you get someone who’s narcissistic, which is to say out of control psychologically, who is ideologically confused, which is to say in over his head. And who does he choose? The most right-wing, reactionary zealots, which lead toward the arbitrary deployment of law, which is what neofascism is, but to reinforce corporate interest, big bank interest, and to keep track of those of us who are cast as other—peoples of color, women, Jews, Arabs, Muslims, Mexicans and so forth and so on. So this is one of the most frightening moments in the history of this very fragile empire and fragile republic. </p><p><strong>11. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/05/31/trump-might-be-the-dimmest-president-ever/?utm_term=.f325eae73ab3">Jennifer Rubin, Washington Post</a>: </strong>Whatever the explanation, Trump does not evidence any greater knowledge or sophistication than he possessed when he entered office. You’d think he would have learned something in four months. Then again, maybe the rudimentary practices of government are simply beyond him. One need not be a psychiatrist nor an educator to see that he is incapable of performing the functions of his job — executing the laws, keeping the nation’s secrets, following routine security procedures. In short, maybe he is not compromised nor mentally ill, but simply dumb. </p><p><strong>12. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/06/just-how-bad-are-things-really-for-donald-trump/">Paul Wood, The Spectator</a>: </strong>Unflattering stories in the U.S. media portray Trump as behaving like, well, Trump. The President is served Diet Coke at lunch while his guests get only water; the President gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream, his guests one. My sources say the President often fails to attend his daily intelligence briefing; when he does, his attention span is disastrously short; he’ll read only documents a page or two long which "must have pictures." Some believe Twitter’s time stamps even show him tweeting during these briefings.</p><p>A regular visitor to the White House told me that leaks about the President shouting at his senior staff were true. "The White House is not a happy place." Television images show Trump getting to the lectern in the West Wing to make an announcement, then forgetting to make it and walking out; Trump’s critics paint a picture of the President as rambling, confused, irritable and prone to tantrums: the madness of King Donald.
<br>
<br>Some of those critics have an explanation for this: not porphyria — the "blue urine" disease that afflicted George III — but dementia. One of the TV news shows that so infuriates the President, MSNBC’s "Morning Joe," devoted a whole segment to this. The host, Joe Scarborough, compared a "mumbling and incoherent" Trump to his aged mother who had dementia — though, he said: "We’re not diagnosing anything."</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>13. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~billmoyers.com/story/president-trump-impeachment/">Michael Winship, BillMoyers.com</a>: </strong>A tune was running through my head...the opening number from the 1980 musical <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~stageagent.com/shows/musical/1466/barnum">Barnum</a>, that glorified the master showman....P.T. Barnum....[T]hat show is long overdue for a revival, although it easily can be argued that there’s no need — P.T. Barnum is alive and well and living in the White House.</p><p dir="ltr">Donald Trump is the con man huckster of all time, and in his sway are the many descendants of those suckers who back in the day provided a steady livelihood for good old P.T. There are differences....But the similarities are there for sure — each man endeavoring to create sideshows that fool both the public and the media with clever tricks that distract the eye. Barnum did it for fun and profit; Trump out of malice, a desperate need for attention and most important to the country, the desire to divert attention from the fact that in less than six months his administration has flamed out in many spectacular ways, while at the same time effectively wrought havoc with representative democracy and government.</p><p dir="ltr">Subverting rules and regulations, upending international agreements and offending other countries while backslapping right-wing nationalists, sending the justice system hurtling back toward the 19th century, enabling the very rich (including himself) to get much, much richer and the poor to fall through the safety net (the Trumpcare debacle) — what we’ve seen in such a short time is a brutish, conscious effort to subvert the inalienable rights both guaranteed and implied by the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>14. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all">Tony Schwartz</a>, ghostwriter of Trump’s autobiography, <em>The Art of the Deal</em>, talking to The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer last July after Trump announced his run for the presidency: </strong>“I put lipstick on a pig,” [Schwartz] said. “I feel a deep sense of remorse that I contributed to presenting Trump in a way that brought him wider attention and made him more appealing than he is.” He went on, “I genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.” If he were writing <em>The Art of the Deal</em> today, Schwartz said, it would be a very different book with a very different title. Asked what he would call it, he answered, “The Sociopath.”</p> <!-- iCopyright Interactive Copyright Notice -->

<!--smart_paging_autop_filter--> <p>We'll find out soon enough if Republicans are craven enough to sell out their constituents' health care in the name of tax cuts for the rich. What we do know is that they're every bit as terrible at governance as they are effective at obstruction. As Paul Krugman writes in his Monday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/opinion/obamacare-repeal.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;_r=0">column</a>, one reason they can't come up with a credible alternative to Obamacare is that, "You can't change any element of the Affordable Care Act without destroying the whole thing." </p><p>The ACA is incrementalist by nature, an acknowledgement that many Americans enjoy their employer-provided insurance and that the insurance industry, with all its lobbying clout, would not allow a single-payer system. To provide better plans at a lower cost to more people, it offers a three-legged stool approach. The first leg, Krugman explains, requires "insurers offer the same plans, at the same prices, to everyone, regardless of medical history." This addresses the problem of pre-existing condidtions, arguably the most-beloved part of legislation, even if Republicans want the public to believe its "death spiral" is imminent.</p><p>Without additional legs, they'd be right: "Healthy people would wait until they got sick to sign up, so those who did sign up would be relatively unhealthy, driving up premiums, which would in turn drive out more healthy people, and so on." The solution was a much less popular leg of the stool, the individual mandate, which Krugman explains is, "a requirement that people sign up for insurance, even if they’re currently healthy. And the insurance must meet minimum standards: Buying a cheap policy that barely covers anything is functionally the same as not buying insurance at all." </p><p>For those who can't afford the individual mandate, the government provides sudsidies. Americans at the very bottom of the economic ladder receive a 100 percent subsidy in the form of Medicaid. This constitutes the third leg of the stool.</p><p>It's a delicate balance, and one that requires extensive cooperation from state governments. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/opinion/obamacare-repeal.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;_r=0">Krugman</a>, "where states have in fact cooperated, expanding Medicaid, operating their own insurance exchanges, and promoting both enrollment and competition among insurers, it has worked pretty darn well."</p><p>But red-state governments have proven largely uncooperative, refusing Medicaid expansions, de-incentivizing competition among insurers, eliminating the individual mandate, and generally cutting off any leg of the stool they can.</p><p>Now Republicans are trying to do the same at a national level. Take, for example, Ted Cruz and his Cruz Amendment, which would allow insurers to offer skeleton plans with minimal coverage and sky-high deductibles. That's fatal to people with pre-existing conditions, effectively cutting off the most popular leg of the ACA and pushing the sickest Americans into the most expensive insurance market.  </p><p>"Obamacare," Krugman reminds us, is "a well-thought-out law that works where states want it to work." Sure, it should be made to work better and more effectively, but Republicans are hell-bent on killing it. It's a tragedy for Americans that they don't have anything in its place. </p><p>Read the entire <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/opinion/obamacare-repeal.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;_r=0">column</a>. </p> <!-- iCopyright Interactive Copyright Notice -->

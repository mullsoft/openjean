<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you were walking down Sunset Boulevard in mid-January—right around the time America’s forty-fifth<sup> </sup>president (a man and a president fit for his time) was inaugurated—you may have come across a familiar, though half-forgotten site: the façade of a video rental store. Through the window was the usual setup: movie advertisements, shelves of VHS tapes, genre signs, a gum ball machine, a couple dorky clerks chitchatting behind the counter, even a curtain with the label XXX, beyond which, you might guess, you could sneak a glimpse of videotaped smut. What was different about this video store—besides the fact that it was 2017, not 1997—was that all the tapes, all the posters, even the celebrity cardboard cut-out and the genre signs plastered high on the shelves were for the same movie: <em>Jerry Maguire</em>. Indeed, it was the only movie available in the entire store, and none of them were for rent. These fifteen thousand “Jerrys,” as they are affectionately known<em>, </em>were put on display by the video/art collective <em>Everything is Terrible! </em>(<em>EIT!</em>), which has been mashing up videos and collecting copies of <em>Jerry Maguire</em> video tapes for about eight years.</p>
<p>On opening night of the exhibit, I watched as about a thousand of LA’s video nerds and scenesters streamed past the wall-to-wall red-and-white Jerry shelves, through the XXX curtains, and into an ankle-deep pool of unspooled <em>Jerry Maguire</em>, wrapping their arms around a cardboard cutout of Tom Cruise talking on his mid-90s flip phone to pinch-zoom and snap Instagram/Facebook/Twitter-ready photos. What (the fuck) to make of this? The store was a meme, hypertrophied and incarnate. Jerrys stacked into pyramids along every wall. Jerry-inspired art selling for hundreds of dollars. Jerry socks. Jerry mix-tapes. A Jerry video game. A treasure chest of still shrink-wrapped Jerrys sent from an adulatory Cameron Crowe (the film’s director). And then the actual (fucking) pyramid—the actual pyramid <em>EIT!</em> is in talks with actual architects to build in the actual desert—a tomb and a shrine “for all the Jerrys to live in for all time,” according to Nic Maier, one of the lead members of the video art collective. Was it Scientological mission creep? A Malkovichian nightmare? A glitch in the matrix? Or a mirror held up to an entire media-drunk generation?</p>
<figure id="attachment_97245" style="width: 495px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-97245 size-full" src="https://www.guernicamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/letter-copy.png" alt="" width="495" height="640" srcset="https://guernica-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/letter-copy.png 495w, https://guernica-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/letter-copy-155x200.png 155w, https://guernica-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/letter-copy-292x378.png 292w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Letter received in the mail by EIT!</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Everything Is Terrible!</em>’s art—a collagist paean to video kitsch—is a sort of technological ekphrasis: a eulogy for one technology through the medium of another. Members of the collective scour thrift stores for video arcana—bizarro exercise tapes, religious propaganda aimed at children, cat massage instructional tracts, farm animal yoga, and job-training videos we were subjected to as pimply teens—splice out the weirdest and most cringe-worthy clips, and upload, revealing the hyper-consumerist age of technology for what it is: navel-gazing, backsliding, and blind—one which spawned the most successful (though abiotic) parasitic form since lice: the smartphone. <em>EIT!</em>’s turretic, share-ready, VHS clips, however, also function as a sharply critical lens to lay bare the hyper-capitalist racism in the center of all the media-frenzy.</p>
<div class="asterisk">*</div>
<p>Besides posting short videos on their site and YouTube channel, <em>EIT!</em> produces feature-length movies (including <em>DoggieWoggiez! PoochieWoochiez!</em>, a remake—created entirely with found footage of dogs—of Jodorowsky’s acclaimed art-house film <em>Holy Mountain</em>), and takes their work on the road with video/live performances in which long-limbed, fuzzy, extraterrestrialish puppets introduce cut footage and push the collective’s ideology of sardonic (or maybe celebratory) nihilism. Their style, though hard to pin down, combines the essence of the Masonic occult, Christmas kitsch, and early <b>’</b>90s white rap. Their palette is pastel and white noise. Their vision is cyclopean. Their energy is strobing, red-eyed, hysterical.</p>
<p>In 2013, after several years of cringe-worthy, eyebrow-raising cutups, <em>EIT!</em> was given access to an entire vault of amateur footage, courtesy of <em>America’s Funniest Home Videos</em>, and began a new series, <em>Memory Hole</em>, which competes for some of the most depressing bandwidth on the web. Sad, often disgusting, pathetically sincere cries for meaning from middle-America’s carpeted living rooms, circa 1995. The only laughter these videos elicit is choking and horror-stricken. See their video &#8220;Picnic In Hell,&#8221; in which two people act out what seems to be the prelude to a real-life horror film—one person serving and slinging spaghetti with their toes, the other holding a live chicken in their mouth and going <em>ruff-ruff</em> like a dog. The video is date stamped, for posterity, March 11, 1997. (<em>Jerry Maguire </em>was almost definitely still in theaters.) I often think, when witnessing these videos, of the Spanish term <em>pena ajena</em>: literally, <em>pity for the other</em>, or being embarrassed for someone else, though the feeling often goes far beyond embarrassment<em>. EIT!</em> seems to exemplify something more: pity for the world. <em>Pena mundial</em>.</p>
<p>Like a dog to his own media vomit, I’ve been drawn to <em>EIT!</em>’s video spectacle since the early years. I’m an old friend of various members of the collective, have—magnanimously—donated a dozen or so Jerrys myself, and have even tagged along for a few stops on one of their Christmas-themed tours, standing in as a giant, eye-glowing, benignly demonic Santa Claus. The absurdity, the exclamatory insistence on <em>everything</em> being terrible, the regurgitated media camp—all of it appealed. But not until I saw the Jerry video store did the multivalent tones of media-obsession and ostentatious cynicism fully cohere into a relevant critique of contemporary culture. I never doubted the artistic or political instincts behind the collective’s project, but mostly I just laughed along, not understanding the depths behind projects like their second feature, <em>2Everything2Terrible2: Tokyo Drift!</em>, a blistering exposé of media’s culturally appropriative, hyper-capitalist underpinnings. The painful to watch, pitiful, dada-like absurdity of their work is a cutting examination of the capitalist-driven media-entertainment juggernaut as it rumbles from media dyspepsia to media ubiquity. It is also an appraisal of our role, as media consumers, in greasing the juggernaut’s wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Rental Store Fetish</strong></p>
<p><em>Jerry </em>(fucking) <em>Maguire,</em> the 1996 film directed by Cameron Crowe and starring Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding, Jr., and Renée Zellweger—racist and misogynist to its core—is an obvious choice for the recreated rental store/pyramid to explicate the headlong late-capitalistic rush that was thinly masked over, for a few years, by the democratic dreaminess of social media. Maier, in speaking of the dueling evanescence/permanence of today’s media, said of the movie: “It’s insane that this thing, this beautiful thing, was created, loved for a second, and then thrown in the trash.” <em>Sic transit gloria mundi</em>, and yet our trash, of course, does not simply disappear after we haul it to the dumpster.</p>
<p>The bizarre, surreal, and nearly overwhelming experience—walking into an all red-and-white store with thousands of Jerrys lining the shelves—was expertly neutralized by the underwhelming <em>familiarity</em> the conceit was enmeshed within. Every detail was, eerily, recognizable. I felt like I was walking back into my suburban childhood: the thin red carpet, the dress code of the clerks (red Jerry shirt, khakis, brown shoes, and brown belt), the “This is What Happens When You Leave a Jerry on Your Dashboard Sign,” complete with a melted VHS tape hanging from a string; the return slot cut into the counter; the XXX curtain; the laminated membership cards. It was a videotape web of time past.</p>
<p>This gap, between underwhelming and overwhelming, is of particular concern for capitalism. The Factory Acts, implemented in nineteenth-century England, scaled back oppressive and demanding workplace conditions not for the sake of the workers, but to keep the workers working—to sustain their presence in an alienating environment, to scale back that feeling of being overwhelmed, and so prod them towards ever greater productivity. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fulfills a similar role today—keeping workers safe so they can keep working. Likewise, shopping centers and shopping markets strive to offer customers everything they want, but within such boundaries that they aren’t paralyzed by a near-infinitude of options. Retail space—the analog equivalent to the Amazon search bar—normalizes an inherently alienating experience. It masks the distance between a product and our consumption of it.</p>
<p>The capitalistic consumption of films exemplifies that distance-shortening: you can observe the rich and the famous within the confines of your living room, as if your world was theirs and vice versa, simply by renting a VHS tape or, today, by streaming media online. <em>The Jerry Maguire Video Store</em> both accentuates and diminishes the viewer/renter’s sense of alienation. The absurdity of a single-movie rental store calls attention to the industrial relationship itself, and at the same time the detailed reproduction of the space—playing on nostalgia—softens the feeling of overwhelmingness/alienation. As factory owners (at least in the global north) have learned to steer towards the sweet spot between worker productivity and worker exploitation, marketers and store managers similarly navigate between inciting desire and inciting disgust: superfluity glistening in fruit pyramids within blocks of starvation; media glut balanced by declines in literacy. This, in part, was <em>EIT!</em>’s project: you witness a stomach-turning display of overmuch—fifteen thousand (fucking) Jerrys—but at the same time your experience is normalized by the familiarity of the setting, the uber-comfort of the rental store.</p>
<p><strong>Harnessing Awe: The Sacred Is for Adults Only</strong></p>
<p>The pyramid, however, does the opposite of softening. It defamiliarizes; it turns the corporeal sacred. The pyramid signifies that you should approach with caution. “You have to go inside: that’s part of it,” Maier said. You have to cross the boundary, consummate the choice. You have to pick a video.</p>
<p>The hysterical psychedelia of <em>EIT!</em>’s videos reveals not only the nonsense present in almost all Hollywood creations, but also the cultish influence of Hollywood not as art incubator, but as capitalist scaffolding. The pyramid—with all of its occult symbolism—is the heart of media and entertainment: the self-celebratory galas, the drone swarms, the impossible costumes, the incestuous celebrity-palace intrigue. It is no wonder that the enormous collection of Jerrys is going to live in a pyramid “for all time,” according to Maier—to be found by future archaeologists, or aliens, along with L. Ron Hubbard’s stainless steel tablets. “Keep Doing God’s Work,” one fan wrote in a note to the collective, sent along with a package of Jerrys.</p>
<p>The pyramid represents exclusion, predestination, lack of choice. Thus, while <em>EIT!</em>&#8216;s recreated video store takes “the renter” through the false (and historic) space of <b>’</b>90s-era choicefulness, of weekends summoning the divine into your family room, celebrating the exceptional democratic experience of access, possibility, and hope, the Jerry pyramid lays bare the violence of this falsity: only the priestly or penitent enter the pyramid, only the wealthiest, the most powerful, the most blue-blooded are enshrined. The plebeians or slaves may lay the bricks, they may awe or ogle, they may pay their respects in tithes, likes, or sacrificial blood, but they must stay on this side of the velvet rope. The pyramid, like the Hollywood sign, is a symbol of unattainable dreams, and yet it encourages <em>dreaming</em>, an act Wolfgang Streeck calls “the most powerful impediment to political radicalization and collective action.”</p>
<p><strong>The Dialectic of Adumbration</strong></p>
<p>The rental store exists for you to submit cash to the media industry, to spend two hours passively perpetuating a racist/capitalist/misogynist view of the world. Adorno and Horkheimer couldn’t be more accurate when, writing seventy years ago in <em>The Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, they wrote of culture “infecting everything with sameness.” The apparent variety of choice in a video rental store masks the true paucity of choice: no matter what video you choose, you’re going home with <em>Jerry Maguire.</em> Adorno and Horkheimer: “The truth that [movie studios] are nothing but business is used as an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce.”</p>
<p><em>EIT!</em> commodifies an already commodified art form. Unlike the mathematical double-negative, however, commodifying the commodified does not shield an object from the dagger of the minus sign, or from the market’s rampant thingification. And that’s <em>EIT!’s </em>point—they are amplifying the essence of the industry (as their name unironically suggests), not offering a “better” or “less terrible” vision.</p>

<p>In “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” Walter Benjamin writes how our changes in perception (and consumption of media) influence and ultimately change our entire mode of existence. Today, our sense perception, as well as our self projection is increasingly channeled through mobile screens. We know ourselves through the mediums we wield. We embody our online persona, and not the reverse.</p>
<p>Benjamin: “To pry an object from its shell, to destroy its aura, is the mark of a perception whose ‘sense of the universal quality of things’ has increased to such a degree that it extracts it even from a unique object by means of reproduction.” While a <em>Jerry </em>tape is by no means a unique work of art, the movie itself so embodies the idea of “Movie” that it could almost be titled as such. The plot, the acting, the score—none of it matters, none of it impresses. It was produced, distributed, quoted, and celebrated as an end in itself—the superstructure (the paying audience cowing before the flashing screen) is the sine qua non of the media/entertainment industry. The scenesters stream in; they unholster their screens; they shoot; they upload. The content is superfluous.</p>
<p>In Don DeLillo’s novel <em>White Noise</em>, the &#8220;most photographed barn&#8221; represents the empty cultivation of aura—that the act of viewing is as important to aura as the object itself. The barn’s reputation outweighs and surpasses its physical presence. Viewers, tourists, and photographers are drawn to the barn because it has been viewed, visited, and photographed before. Instagrammers similarly cultivate aura with every new popular Instagrammable location, backdrop, or food item, uploading not because they like the movie or the location or the dish, but because through the stars, the scene, or the restaurant, they are cultivating an aura. They effortlessly participate in aurification. The shared digital photograph becomes the means by which the consumer makes conspicuous consumption conspicuous. In turn, we cultivate our own auras through the conspicuous aurification of the &#8220;most photographed barn&#8221; or the Jerry cardboard cutout. The German term of this is <em>Vergesellschaftung</em>, which Streeck defines as “an act of purchase—concluding, as it often does, a lengthy period of introspective exploration of one’s very personal preferences (read: laps around the video rental store)—as an act of self-identification and self-presentation, one that sets the individual apart from some social groups while uniting him or her with others.” Of course, posting a selfie isn’t exactly a purchase, but, by commodifying an image of the self and the “barn” (the Jerry Store), by submitting to the market waves churned up by social media, you turn the wheel of a capitalist relationship between owners and laborers: submitting yourself to advertising and propagating advertisements for profit’s sake. (Or, maybe better said, for the prophets’ sake: the late Jobs, the rising Musk, the ubiquitous Bezos, the baby-faced Zuckerberg.)</p>
<p>What differentiates the Jerry cardboard cut-out is that it has already been, in effect, Instagrammed/aurificated by <em>EIT!</em>. They created, or exposed, its aura of empty ubiquity, of speculative existence (as in speculative economics) by collecting it <em>ad absurdum</em>. Dimitri Simakis, long-time member of <em>EIT!</em>, as well as Regional Outreach Coordinator for The Jerry Maguire Video Store, described to me a sort of epiphanic moment he had in 2016 while he was working at the “social news and entertainment company” <em>Buzzfeed. </em>He watched as, one Friday afternoon, a group of young co-workers, enspirited by the coming weekend, assured of what seemed an inevitable Hillary Clinton victory, as well as a general American goodness, started dancing to a Taylor Swift song. “It’s okay,” Simakis guess-paraphrased their thinking, “Obama’s president, Beyoncé has a new album, everything is okay.” And yet, as <em>EIT!</em> makes abundantly clear (and many of us are all too aware) everything is not okay. Empty consumerism, American positivism, and the “inclusive” celebration of a few famous black people is, along with everything, (fucking) <em>Terrible!</em> A single available movie at the rental store may liberate us from the perceived oppressiveness of choice, but—more to the point—it also keeps us locked to the nipple of the entertainment industry. Media engagement—whether by renting or streaming, uploading, or trolling—is a dependency (addiction) masked over by a colorful facade of “personal expression.”</p>
<p><strong>Jerry <em>an sich</em> (Neutral Media Is Racist Media)</strong></p>
<p><em>Jerry Maguire</em>, like most movies (and like capitalism) is racist, misogynist, and, as Simakis told me, “anti-humanity.” “I think Cameron Crowe knew he was making an anti-humanity movie.” Simakis recounted Jerry’s antipathy toward the heartthrob toddler Ray Boyd (played by Jonathan Lipnicki) throughout the movie. Jerry shirks from touching the kid, loving the kid, and constantly side-eyes him with disdain. Likewise, his (only) friendship is based in greed and laced with racism, and his love for Dorothy (Zellweger) is tepid, at best. Defenders might claim that Jerry claiming “I’m Mister Black People” or screaming “I love black people” is a comic airing of post-racist fondness. Jerry, however, is desperate; he forces Tidwell (Gooding, Jr.) to dance for him, to be his entertainer, to be commodified into his capitalistic schema in order to reap his agent’s cut, and is in no true sense his friend. The familiar commodification of black bodies and black culture, via white exaltation of rap music, athletic prowess, and ebonics, is exemplified by Jerry’s relationship to Tidwell. And the commodification/patronization doesn&#8217;t remain within the confines of the screen. It was also reformatted for the Oscar stage.</p>
<p>When Cuba Gooding, Jr. boisterously whooped and clicked his heels on the stage (while accepting his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), he was leading the way for America to accept Barack Hussein Obama. Despite the subversive “un-American” name (applying to both men), we clapped along with Cuba (during the Oscar’s audience’s patronizing standing ovation) and also recognized his volatility: he had <em>too much</em> stage energy, which stage-managers attempted to drown out with music. He yip-yipped, he ranted, he bounded; his energy was unrestrained. And though black men, of course, had been in the national spotlight before, Gooding, Jr.’s presence was both explicitly about race and also explicitly about acceptance itself, coming at a time when racial tensions had been bubbling anew.</p>
<p>The unmerited obsession with and unprecedented distribution of <em>Jerry Maguire</em>—three million copies of the tape sold on the first day of its release—came at the end of an era, the late-capitalist Clinton boom (boom for some) years, the last hurrah of VHS (before DVD), and the supposed national soothing of racial tensions after the violent strife (Rodney King, the O.J. trial) of the early and middle decade. The year 1996 thus heralded another transitional period, about a decade later, in 2008, when media was transitioning from DVD to digital, neoliberal capitalism had visibly derailed, and President Obama brought a message—however erroneous or eulogistic—of hope and calm to the country.</p>
<p>Gooding, Jr. himself thus symbolized a bridge with bi-racial appeal. His character had to literally coach Jerry through pronouncing the words, “I love black people.” And yet Tidwell’s prowess and confidence weren’t enough to win over the willingness of the market forces on their own. Jerry had to take him there.</p>
<p>You can smile and sing, and even be athletic, but you need to show that you can <em>contain</em> that energy. Obama, an athlete, and a decent singer, was accused by many of not being black enough. It’s hard to imagine the criticism, however, if he had openly displayed his “blackness,” as comedians Key and Peele exaggerated in their skits of Obama’s “anger translator.” The performance of blackness is encouraged only when it fits into the racist capitalist schema. As Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote of Barack Obama in <em>The Atlantic</em>, “Obama’s embrace of white innocence was demonstrably necessary as a matter of political survival.” Gooding, Jr., after wooing America with his heel-click on the Oscars’ stage, was subsequently relegated to middling roles, and fell (or was pushed) into half-obscurity, until reemerging to play the black antihero of the <b>’</b>90s: O.J. Simpson, in the FX true-crime series <em>The People v. O.J. Simpson</em>.</p>
<p>In real life (however much it was media-hyped and variously filtered), Simpson’s exoneration served as the vindication of decades of the LAPD’s abuse, brutality, and oppression of the black community, though Simpson himself had distanced himself from racial discourse, holing up in the exclusive (and nearly exclusively white) Brentwood community of Los Angeles. Gooding, Jr. seems to play the role by channeling not only the celebrated, and then vilified, real-life character of O.J., but by working through his own story of being celebrated onstage for cartoonishly portraying a black stereotype in a racist film. As <em>EIT!</em> so exuberantly celebrates, Gooding, Jr. is the nonpareil of anti-mimesis: his role as O.J., it seems, is an on-screen exercising of his own torn past. If <em>EIT! </em>were directing, the series might continue beyond the O.J. trial, all the way up to the release of <em>Jerry Maguire</em>, and maybe, if things had turned out differently, O.J. would have snagged Gooding, Jr.’s role. The lines between actor and character, between news and entertainment, between media and marketing, have been twisted into a knot. Cue the title screen: Everything is&#8230;</p>

But as environmental discourse grows increasingly politicized, what is often missing is simple expression of love for nature and a recognition of its transformative power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pleasure derived from nature—and how this pleasure can prompt stewardship—permeates Leslie T. Sharpe’s new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1468312472/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1468312472&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gueamagofarta-20&amp;linkId=34adaa5a43249fc825bcb4b63f22c18a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Quarry Fox: And Other Critters of the Wild Catskills</em></a>. “There is nothing so sublime that is so readily accessible as the natural world,” Sharpe writes. “To experience it, one only has to look, to train oneself to truly see, and perhaps most important, to allow oneself to be amazed.” Sharpe, former vice president of the New York City Audubon Society and editor of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Urban Audubon, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">learned to open her eyes and heart to the splendor of nature as a child at the Jersey Shore, where she was taken with the mole crab “using its feathery antennae to catch minute organisms for food,” and became fascinated with “a world mostly unseen by humans and indifferent to them.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Quarry Fox</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharpe opens a window onto the world of critters—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bluebirds, black bears, bobcats, woodcocks, foxes—recording, as she writes, “the drama of their everyday lives with objectivity.” No critter is too small or insignificant for the author’s admiration. At one point she rescues a luna moth from a spiderweb and painstakingly peels off the strands of web stuck to its wings. “I knew I should shoo it away,” she writes, “go back inside, turn off the light, and let the Luna do its urgent work this warm June evening. But for just a few minutes more, I wanted to sit there with the moth, to feel the lightness of the Luna’s being, its weight no more than a breath, to hold beauty in my hand.” Sharpe’s passion is heartwarming, but more importantly, it engenders a deep sense of regard for the future of these creatures and the often precarious wilderness they inhabit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What earns this book its place alongside those of John Burroughs, Henry David Thoreau, Aldo Leopold, and Annie Dillard are Sharpe’s elegant meditations on the interconnectedness of humans and the natural world. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To see him fly so high,” she writes of the male woodcock, “sky dancing in the dusk, executing his extraordinary twists and turns, is to be inspired and reminded that within each of us—as unassuming as we may seem, set in our daily routines, so that for the most part, we go unnoticed—is the potential for brilliance, for some moment of transcendence, when we rise above the everyday and become transfigured by our own specialness.”</span></p>
<p>Sharpe brings to life the subtle, so easily frayed relationships that link our ecosystems, lending the book a particular urgency in our current political moment. It is hard to dismiss the white-nose-syndrome epidemic affecting cave bats in the United States after learning of their significance in stemming mosquito-borne illnesses and providing pest control. Even the dandelion, “that cheerful scourge of suburban front yards,” has a place in the web of life as a favorite of honeybees—crucial pollinators whose decline poses real threats to agriculture.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I met Sharpe in a West Village café on a gloomy March afternoon in Manhattan. We spoke about responsible stewardship, nature writing as a “singular American genre,” and its importance at a time when environmental protections are under fire.</span></p>
<p>—<em>Daniela Petrova for</em> Guernica</p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where does your love for nature come from?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It really came from my family. My parents were huge animal lovers; we had dogs, cats, birds, and goldfish. I even had a baby alligator that my sister brought from Florida and gave to me as a pet when she was in college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We went for nature walks in the fall. In the summer, we went to the Jersey Shore, where I discovered the crabs that I talk about in the introduction to the book. I find them the most fascinating creatures, especially for their courage. I don’t think they realize how small they are. There you are, a ten-story building, towering over them, and they are not intimidated. I think, as a child, a shy child, witnessing their ferocity—which is so out of proportion to their size—I was completely taken by them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the great things you can do for a child is to expose him or her to the natural world. Because nature provides not only a way of connecting you to the outside world but it also connects you to yourself. We know that people feel better when they are in nature. Two recent British studies show that people are happier then. They experience awe, joy, and contentment. What’s so interesting to me is that one of these studies shows that not only direct exposure to nature but also just watching nature shows increases people’s happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you experience nature, you realize how everything is interconnected and that human beings are at the center of that connectedness, the web of life. I think the problem is that many of us are so removed from nature that we don’t understand that what’s going on in the natural world also impacts us. For example, if the honeybees continue to decline—the die-off has been linked to pesticides, for starters—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’ll have a problem with pollination. Bees can pollinate over 75 percent of flowering plants and crops, and without them, we would lose certain foods, including blueberries, strawberries, and some vegetables.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a naturalist? How does that differ from an environmentalist?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They’re not mutually exclusive. A naturalist is someone who observes nature, simple as that—who watches critters daily or over the course of years and records their doings. Some of our most important information about birds and other critters is from amateurs simply observing wildlife. Certainly, naturalists are conservationists, those who look to conserve wildlife and their habitats, and by extension, they are environmentalists, though the latter may focus less on species and more on issues such as air and water, and other vital resources and the impacts of industry on such.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you talk a bit about the history of nature writing as a genre?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature writing is a singular American genre. John Burroughs, writing in the middle to the second half of the nineteenth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, really invented the nature essay. To Europeans, America in the nineteenth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century presented a world of still wild and untamed nature. Which is what the Hudson River School artists painted. The American land is so vast in its iconography and that landscape has in many ways defined who we are. So you have Thoreau and Emerson, the Romantics, looking at nature and seeing it almost as a way to find the divine within oneself, connecting to nature in a spiritual way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature writing still remains a very powerful form—it’s a way of chronicling the American experience that not only shows the grandeur but also the degradation of our natural systems. At the same time it also offers hope for the vitality of this country’s spirit through conservation and the environmental movement. Nature has always been America’s moral compass. This landscape has defined us, and if we lose it, we risk losing our soul.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">How so? What are some examples of this?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The greed for short-term gain, which evinces itself everywhere these days, including in the seizing and exploitation of resources—even proposing drilling for oil and mining in national monuments—is indeed an example of potentially impacting the soul and the psyche of this country. Our national parks are America. Not only do many Americans find respite and solace and vacation in these places, but also, these landscapes, and their conservation, are what have set us apart in the world.</span></p>
<p>So many people responded to Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz’s suggestion to sell off 3.3 million acres of public land for development. People from Utah, his home state, New Mexico, Colorado, and Montana, among others—an extraordinary coalition of conservationists, hunters, and concerned citizens—stood up and said, &#8220;No! We want our land to be preserved.&#8221; Because when people look at their landscapes, they see themselves as part of something grand and glorious; losing such landscapes diminishes our soul and impacts our identity.</p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you think environmental protections—and the EPA itself—are under fire to such an extent right now?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Part of the problem is that people take nature for granted. The water that you drink: you turn on the tap and there it is. Up in the Catskills, my water comes out of a spring in the mountain. I have lost water in times of drought, which is happening more now with global warming. And we’ve had three devastating floods in the past ten years. Luckily, I live on the side of the mountain, but two-thirds of my road was lost in 2006 and the nearby village was under eight feet of water. These are a result of climate change, pure and simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many feel insulated from these dangers because much of the population is located in city centers. It’s those of us who are closer to the source of our most valued resources who get it. We see the loss of the bats, of the bees; there are fewer songbirds in the spring. People don’t have to care about the songbirds in the way I do, but the destruction of their habitat also affects the forests, the &#8220;lungs of the earth.&#8221; Everything is connected that way. And the animals, who share the planet with us, are usually the ones who tell us. Like the canary in the coal mine, which told miners, at the risk of its own life, whether the air was safe to breathe, birds, and animals in general, are still serving that purpose.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You write, “In a sense, the eco-holocaust that the Catskills suffered was also a call to conscience that marked the beginning of the modern conservationist movement.” Can you describe how?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Catskills were the first great American wilderness found by Europeans, but its integrity was soon lost to over-exploitation of resources, primarily by the tanning industry, in the nineteenth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century. You clear-cut the woods, loosening the soil, and then the soil goes into the streams, the streams silt up, and the life in them dies. You take the trees away, there is nothing to cool the streams, then the fish disappear. The Catskills were so degraded that they influenced a seminal book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man and Nature</span></i><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">by George Perkins March, in 1864. That book, revolutionary for its day, argued that heedless human acts could impact the environment negatively. The Adirondack Forest Preserve was founded as a result, not because people said, “Oh, we love the trees,” but because they wanted to protect the region’s waterways since New York State had a water-dependent commerce. That was the first example of sustainability—the preservation of natural resources—as sound economic policy.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you see more examples of that today? </span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Numerous towns in upstate New York voted no to fracking, despite the fact that the area is so economically depressed. As one dairy farmer said to me, “I can’t drink gas and my cows can’t neither.” This decision affected both the watershed and the foodshed—the water New Yorkers drink and our upstate economy, which is heavily based on dairy and farming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In New York City, one of our big focuses was preserving the integrity of the Hudson River estuary. The Clean Water Act of 1972 had done a lot to clear the waters. But development, unrestricted, was threatening aspects of the estuary. A big concern then was preserving old wooden pilings—what we call pile fields. It had been discovered that fish liked to hover near these structures. They were found to be important for spawning and for young fish to hide, and therefore to grow. Some of these fish are very important economically: sturgeon, striped bass, shad. These populations have been overfished. We knew that for them to recover, development would have to allow these structures to stay. And that happened. They exist in the Hudson today, often topped with art installations. Here is an example of preservation also being sound economic policy. These fish populations, now recovering, are potentially very valuable—giving people fishery jobs and food.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When did you first learn the importance of preservation?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In second grade, when I was president of Junior Audubon, I had a little book with stamps with pictures of birds. But there was one bird, the passenger pigeon, that, as the story goes, used to blacken the sky, there were so many of them. But they’d been hunted into extinction. It really made an impression on me and still haunts me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I write in <em>The</em> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quarry Fox</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, extinction seems an intellectual concept, a distant—whether in the past or future—event. But I’ve been living in the Catskills since 2003, and I’m witnessing the extinction of the little brown bats in this part of the world because of white-nose syndrome (WNS), a fungus of unknown origin that is affecting cave bat species.  The little brown bats have been reduced, in the Northeast, by 90 percent. One of these bats can eat six hundred mosquitoes in an hour. Consider that impact on the environment!</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What inspired you to write about your experiences living in the Catskills?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The first essay I wrote was called “A Passion for Bluebirds.” I was entirely consumed with these pretty little songbirds. I even rigged an umbrella over the bluebird box to shade them because it was so hot that summer. They are such beautiful birds and you fall in love with their devotion to their nestlings and to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next piece I wrote was “The Quarry Fox.” The reason I named the book after that essay was because it has such an important message: when people, even well-intentioned, intervene with wildlife, it usually ends badly for the wildlife. My quarry fox got too friendly, too close to people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, that first essay about the bluebirds didn’t make the book’s final cut. You have to consider the project as a whole first—in this case, my editor thought the book was “bird heavy,” so I did another chapter about wild cats. The lesson to writers here is that the good of the book comes before your own ego. If I do a sequel, the bluebirds will have a starring role.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You rarely use the term &#8220;wild animals.&#8221; Instead, you refer to the animals you encounter as critters. Can you elaborate on that distinction?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Critters&#8221; is, for me, affectionate, while&#8221;‘animals&#8221;—it’s not exactly pejorative, but that word somehow puts a dividing line between us and them. But we are animals too. We’re really not that much different. What we’re learning more and more is not what separates us from wildlife but what unites us in our behaviors.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we spend more time attached to our electronic devices, do you fear that we’re losing our connection to nature? Are our children less likely to experience it?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think that if you give a child a chance to experience nature, he or she will put the device away. But it’s about giving children a chance. Technology can be a tool for enhancing our experience with nature. And besides, technology’s not going anywhere and I’m as captive to it as anybody else. The Internet is such an incredible information source, a research tool. It’s just too easy to say that technology is a bad thing. Now you can take your iPad outside with you and figure out what that bird call is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a good example. The thrushes have slightly different songs, each sounding like a flute being played in the woods. Is that a wood thrush or a hermit thrush? I go right to a website and it tells me. I wouldn’t have been able to write this book without my iPad. Of course I used books for my research, but where did I find these books? In my bibliography there is a website section.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As former vice president of the New York City Audubon Society and an editor of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Urban Audubon, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can you talk a bit about being a naturalist in an urban environment?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What people don’t know is the amount of urban nature there is, not just in New York City, but in any urban environment. New York City Audubon is a big player in the New York environmental world, not only regarding general environmental issues but also as regards the natural world. We have a program called Harbor Herons that protects small islands in the Hudson and East Rivers, little spits of land that are largely unknown but that are crucial areas for migrating water and shore birds to nest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamaica Bay Wild Refuge is extraordinary because it has the bay, uplands, and lowlands. There is a recent documentary narrated by Susan Sarandon, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saving Jamaica Bay</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about local, grassroots efforts to preserve it. It’s important not only for the community of people who live on Broad Channel but also for the incredible wildlife that’s there. Wetlands are among the most valuable and productive natural areas for life, including spawning fish, which shelter there.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You writing is incredibly lyrical—why is that important to the subject matter?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All I’m trying to do is write readable prose that serves the function of bringing people into a different world. And that’s the world of the mountain where I live. John Gardner said in his book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Art of Fiction</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that writing fiction should be like entering a dream. In creative nonfiction—and that includes autobiography, memoir, personal essay, narrative nonfiction—we use</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fictional devices such as dialogue, scene setting,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">vivid description, to tell a true story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way I write—with a lyricism people may associate with fiction or poetry—reflects my own style and sensibility, but its purpose is to bring people into a different world. It has been said about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Quarry Fox</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it has clarity and simplicity but at the same time is a subtle, quiet work in a very unsubtle, noisy world. So it provides a respite for readers.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also a tremendous amount of humor and playfulness in your experiences with the critters—a surprise to readers like me who might have expected a dry account of different species and their behavior.</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When we see humor, in nature or anywhere, we experience affection. [As I write] in the introduction, when I encountered the crayfish, I was so startled. I had my gloves on, fortunately, when this tiny three-inch critter snagged me with its claw.  I had to laugh out of appreciation for its courage.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you hope readers will take from your book?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The ultimate purpose of this book is to connect people to the natural world, to introduce them to the interconnections between flora and fauna—interconnections that impact us, that we ourselves are part of. I wanted to share my wild critters’ world with people not only to encourage the conservation of habitat but also to illustrate the larger issue of how habitat and species loss can affect us. If the critters fail, we are all going to fail. If we don’t have bees we are not going to eat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was writing the book, I was often on the local Catskills NPR affiliate, WIOX. One of the hosts called me “the ambassador of the critters of the Catskills.” And that’s how I started seeing myself. So many people have said to me that a whole new world—the world of the naturalist—has opened up to them, reading </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Quarry Fox.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is so much pleasure in nature, as the recent British studies show, inspiring in us feelings of awe, contentment, and joy. One of the components of awe is gratitude, and I have come out of the woods with tears in my eyes at the sheer beauty of this world.</span></p>
<p><b>Guernica: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What scares you most as you look to the future?</span></p>
<p><b>Leslie T. Sharpe:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Extinction. It’s happening, of so many critters in every ecosystem. And ecosystems, such as the coral reefs, are dying too. Ultimately, we can’t sustain life—and that includes human life—without these productive ecosystems. Our own survival, as a species, is at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People always talk about the cruelty of nature, but they miss the point that what it is really about—whether you subscribe to everything Darwin said or not—is the survival of species. And that can be hard for us to grasp. Like when I watched two fawns grow up who made it through winter, and right before spring, I found one of them dead. Nature has no regard for our sentiments, does not play favorites, as we do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I write in the book, the doe and the sibling, that little fawn’s family, had moved on, and I have to, too. My only consolation was that the dead fawn would feed the mountain. The bobcat would come, the fox, the turkey vultures, the coyotes. . . </span></p>

I believed Baba was coming to Oklahoma to stay. We drove to the airport around noon on a blistering Oklahoma Sunday. Maman allowed us to miss church for it and we took pleasure in putting on casual clothes, packing bottles of ice water. Kian brought an old Game Boy. The sun blazed through the windows and within five minutes we were sweat-stained and nauseated. Kian and I wore thrift store shorts and t-shirts with faded brand names; Maman wore jeans and a nice blouse from Iran. She was trying to strike a balance. Iranian women fret constantly over their looks, but she didn’t want Baba to think she missed him.</p>
<p>She fired questions at us, oblivious to the answers. “Are you excited to see your Baba?” “Kian, do you have your poem?” “Niloo, I told you, no shorts. Do you want your Baba to think you’ve become some kind of American <em>dokhtare kharab</em>?”</p>
<p>Maman’s biggest fear for me since the day I turned thirteen (a year earlier) was that I would become a <em>dokhtare kharab</em>, a “broken girl,” which is the Iranian way of describing a sexually free person who happens to be female—she thought I was more prone to it than average, because of my shared DNA with Baba. The male version of the word, as in most cultures, is something along the lines of <em>playful</em>.</p>
<p>Kian nudged me in the ribs and started singing an annoying song he had made up that made Maman giggle. Sometimes she would tease him by humming his toddler revolution song. “The caged bird is heartsick of walls,” she would croon in a baby lisp. Kian would sing the rest and they carried on their mother-son infatuation. I hated it. I didn’t know to miss Baba in those moments.</p>
<p>Maybe because I was a daughter, or because I was <em>Baba’s</em> daughter, Maman reserved all her austerity for me. She forbade me from wearing a drop of makeup and only gave in to my demand to shave my legs when she saw that my hairiness defied modesty and she could neither let me out looking like that nor force me to wear long pants in the stifling Oklahoma heat. Always crammed in tiny rooms with Maman and Kian, I craved the smallest privacy.</p>
<p>Sometime during our years as asylum seekers, I stopped playing children’s games. I forgot books I had loved and lyrics to Farsi songs, and started to dream about having my own apartment in a big city. In Oklahoma, I made secret plans, borrowing college admissions guides from the public library, readying myself for my second escape—this sleepy flatland was no home to me, and it would be worth any hard work and indignity now if I could just find my own. The other children had never met someone from the Middle East, never considered dreams or demons other than their own, and they didn’t invite me into their narrow universe. They didn’t explain their song lyrics, the rules for dodgeball, or how to pronounce the many words I mangled. Left to entertain myself, I lived inside my imagination. Soon I decided that to find safety here and to re-create the sense of home, I needed two things: money and the air of being a <em>real </em>American (an elusive formula that brought me daily shame). In order to prepare for my excellent future in a big city, I lived off pita bread and egg whites, swam a thousand meters daily, and never stopped moisturizing my legs. I studied twelfth-grade calculus seven hours a day.</p>
<p>“He won’t think I’m <em>kharab</em>,” I said to Maman; “he’s seen my grades.”</p>
<p>“Grades have nothing to do with it,” said Maman.</p>
<p>I scoffed. “Are you new to Baba? With enough As, I could go to school naked.”</p>
<p>“Niloo!” She slammed her hands on the wheel. “Don’t start.” She took two breaths. “Please remember that, to your Baba, you will seem so changed. He might have a hard time. Just try to be the sweet Niloo and Kian I know are still in there.”</p>
<p>I started having nightmares around the time we arrived in the first refugee hostel. The dreams changed over the years, but never disappeared, and I came to think that missing limbs and phantom stranglers and dying parents were simply the price of sleep. At fourteen, most of my nightmares involved my classmates exposing me for this or that. I was afraid they would find out that I had missed an entire decade of American music, that I was from that country that forces women into drabness, that I knew only about a quarter of their slang. I was afraid they’d find out I was afraid. My only antidote to the fear was math and science, concrete pursuits Baba had taught me to trust (a purer love of study didn’t kick in till years later).</p>
<p>Some nights I dreamed about Baba kidnapping me and, in those dreams, his eyes were dead and I knew it was the other Baba, the opium Baba, the tooth-hunting Baba, and that I had to get away.</p>
<p>“Where will he sleep?” I asked, though we had been through this.</p>
<p>Our apartment was nothing remarkable as immigrant situations go, but to me it was a nightmare. Some time spent in typical pass-through countries, Italy and the United Arab Emirates, had depleted the funds. We had Maman’s small income and a dark, two-bedroom apartment on the first floor of a two-story complex. At first, Maman and I shared a room. Then Kian and I. And soon, we would probably switch back. It depended on who she thought needed more privacy at the time, herself or Kian. Never me, because privacy was the sole missing ingredient between me and <em>dokhtare kharab</em>. She kept it from me like the accidental drop of egg yolk that might turn a bowl of fluffy meringue peaks into a flat, sloppy sugar soup.</p>
<p>We agreed that Baba would sleep in one bedroom with Kian, and I would share with Maman again. We also agreed that Maman’s “friend,” Nader, who had come from Kermanshah before the revolution, would not stop by during Baba’s stay. On most nights, Nader would appear around six or seven and cook various delicious meats for us. He always had pungent things marinating and sloshing in clear bowls in the fridge—goopy red and yellow mixtures full of fleshy raw chunks that became exquisite after a quick bake or sauté or barbecue. Nader could stand shirtless in headphones, cigarette dangling from his lips, holding a skillet of broccoli and looking like a doofus, then flick his wrist and somehow land every single piece on its other side, not a spear burned. Sometimes he’d ask me to add a pinch of turmeric, and when I did, he would wince. “A pinch, kiddo, a pinch!” As if a pinch means anything.</p>
<p>“Don’t call me <em>kiddo</em>,” I said, “and pinches aren’t really a scientific measure.”</p>
<p>I wished Nader would go away. I vaguely knew that Maman and Baba had divorced—Baba had been unwilling to leave his village, his respectable job, his roots, and his opium. After Maman fell into great danger in Iran, they had no choice but to go their separate ways. Besides, Baba had helped her escape, and if they had stayed married, how could he deny involvement during the hours of questioning that followed? I understood the situation, however begrudgingly. It wasn’t loyalty to Baba that made me dislike this new man—Nader was just annoying.</p>
<p>On the phone, as I grew up, Baba always asked for stories and photos, especially photos. “Send a stack of the doubles. Anything you’ve taken, not just the special ones.” And when we were too distracted, he would find excuses: a document he needed or a magazine he wished to read or a bottle of special American moisturizer. Maman made time to send these items, and so he would say as he gave her his lists, “Please include a stack of the kids’ photos. Don’t forget.”</p>
<p>Eventually, when Maman became busier with two jobs and church and night school, when I started high school and swimming and more college prep, the only thing that would get us to the post office was requests for therapeutic socks, because we knew Baba wasn’t lying about the dangerous varicose veins in his legs. We imagined him aging in that difficult country where these things aren’t so freely available and people learn simply to suffer. So, every few weeks, Baba would call. “Please send more of the special tight socks,” he would say, then add, “Maybe throw in a stack of your doubles. Where was the last roll you shot? Is it a good story?”</p>
<p>It would be unfair to say that by fourteen, I had forgotten my Baba. I thought of him often. But I stopped missing him and, before this trip was announced, I had stopped actively hoping that he would join us. It began to feel likely that he never would, and that my parents’ promises of those first months out of Iran were mostly lies. I became a teenager. I worried about my future constantly. I was desperate to fall in love, and I was desperate to keep from falling in love, because I knew that I had to flee Oklahoma, as my mother had fled Iran.</p>
<p>Now, by some miracle, Baba had secured a tourist visa to visit us, and I cradled the secret hope that he was joining us for good—Baba and I would have to scheme, of course, as in the old days when we snuck cream puffs into the house; Maman had said nothing of it. We arrived at Will Rogers World Airport a few minutes early, feeling awkward in our skins, in our haircuts and clothes. We waited at the terminal for him to disembark the plane from JFK Airport. As the passengers filed out, some of them fresh from a short trip, others ragged after long international flights, I felt a shiver in my leg. I wanted so much for every next passenger to be him. Each time I saw the shadow of a grown man turn the corner, or a familiar gait, or a person laden with bags, I was certain it was him and my right hand flew to my right ear. If there’s a gesture more soothing than pulling on one’s own earlobe, I have yet to find it, and in those first immigrant years this habit became a second tic for me—I had rid myself of the one in my neck shortly after our arrival. Maman took my hand and held it to her chest, and we continued to wait.</p>
<p>In the end, he surprised us, walking out last, with the flight attendants, smiling his big, hairy Cheshire grin as they handed him his four cigarette lighters and book of matches. “He’s shorter,” I whispered to Maman. She didn’t hush me or tell me to watch my manners. She looked at Baba in a daze and said, “<em>You’re</em> taller.”</p>
<p>When he saw us, he burst into an exhausted guffaw, laughing as he spread out his arms and tried to scoop up all three of us at once. It was an awkward motion, and passersby kept glancing at us, but there was no stopping it. Baba’s joy was like a piece of luggage tumbling down a steep escalator. You don’t try to stop a thing with that much mass and momentum. You get out of the way. He was laughing and crying, swiping at his eyes with a big hairy hand, making such a show. I don’t remember my Baba having ever been so loud, so graceless. Red tufts burst from his shirt, which was unbuttoned to his chest. His hair was a mess, and now that I was taller, I could see the spot of bald in the back, among the baby-soft wisps that were still cut in a long, youthful style.</p>
<p>“Is this my Niloo?” he whispered, putting a sweaty palm to my cheek. Somehow my words flew away and I stood there dumbly, not saying hello, not saying <em>It’s</em> <em>good to see you</em>, <em>Baba joon</em>, as I had practiced. When he touched my cheek, I wanted to jump back, not because of the wetness of his hand but out of some forgotten instinct, an old fear. But I smiled. He said, “Niloo <em>khanom</em>, you’re so tall.” He looked at me for a long time, and when I tried to cut the silence by saying hello, he burst out again, “Oh, you have your incisors back! Let me see.” He was about to put a finger in my mouth, but I recoiled. My expression must have revealed my horror because his eyes darted to his shoes, he pulled back his hand, and he said, “You’re very grown-up, Niloo <em>joon</em>.” He sounded hurt, but I told myself that I had my boundaries, and I had no interest in overhearing nighttime whispers about how I need orthodontics or how I should have my wisdom teeth extracted early. No. I was fourteen. I wanted both of them to leave my body to me.</p>
<p>Baba turned to Maman, “<em>Salam</em>, Pari <em>joon</em>,” he said, his voice kind and low, as if greeting a fellow mourner at a funeral. They hugged silently as Kian and I shifted our weight, fiddled with our backpacks, pulled strings from our fraying shorts. Baba shook Kian’s hand, a proud half smile frozen on his face, and we walked to the car.</p>
<p>Without thinking, Baba went to the driver’s seat, and then there was an awkward moment when they switched. “My turn to sit in front,” said Kian.</p>
<p>“Your Baba is sitting in front,” said Maman, her voice flat and stripped of all emotion so expertly you’d think she were corralling children onto a bus.</p>
<p>“I’ll sit with Niloo in the back,” said Baba. At first I was uneasy. So, to cut the tension, I asked about Uncle Ali—how was he? Did he have a girlfriend? Did he ask about me? Did he know that I have front teeth now? Baba laughed. “He misses you very much,” he said. “And he’s seen all your photos. I made sure he saw.”</p>
<p>The rest of the way home, he asked me questions. About school, about my teeth, my favorite subjects, how much science I had learned. I was happy to drone on about science, since it was safe and concrete. “Pari.” Baba looked up at Maman in the middle of my summary of igneous rocks. “Why does Niloo have an accent?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have an accent!” I shot back, because again they were discussing details of me as if I were a defective blender.</p>
<p>“Do you speak Farsi with them?” he asked her.</p>
<p>“Yes, we speak Farsi,” she said, “but they speak English all day at school.”</p>
<p>He grunted and looked at me, his childlike grin breaking out again like a fast-moving rash. “Do you read poetry?” he asked. I shrugged. He began talking about the importance of poetry, about all the hidden meanings of his favorite poems. As he spoke, he sometimes touched my arm or my shoulder or my cheek, as if I were a piece of silk he was sure he was going to buy. Once, he pulled me to him and gave me a hug that lasted almost a minute, patting my back until I had to push on his chest and free myself. He didn’t seem to mind. He blathered on and on, and I thought, did he always talk this much?</p>
<p>Halfway through his speech, which was animated and fiery, he rested a hand on my knee. I swept it away with a swift motion, like batting away a spider. He gasped, but he didn’t say anything. I’m sure he took it as some kind of weak and misguided fear of men that I must be developing, which he would discuss with Maman later. “Why are you making her this way?” he would say. “Is it your church?”</p>
<p>Despite my fading memories, I remembered that Baba was a hugger, a kisser, a patter of backs and squeezer of cheeks. But no man had hugged or kissed me in more than five years. The most affection I got from Nader was an occasional high five. Now, Baba squirmed on the sweaty plastic seat beside me, tucking his hands in his lap, projecting his distress—something invisible seemed to be slipping from his grasp in dramatic fashion, and my only clues to his private struggle during that forty-minute car ride were his clenched jaw and his pale knuckles pressing into the seat cushion. He looked straight ahead, hungrily chewing his mustache, as if trying to calculate his real daughter’s coordinates. He looked like a man who, given a modicum of magic, would travel through time and take back those six years apart, and the careless tooth extraction before that, and whatever else may have caused his daughter to swipe away his hand. I was old enough to see the pain in Baba’s eyes, and if the moment hadn’t passed so quickly, I would have said that it wasn’t him, that I just needed air-conditioning and some water and a quiet moment alone.</p>
<p>But I didn’t say anything to assuage his sadness. There are creatures a person can see at thirty to which she has no access at fourteen. In youth, she can see only the end of the creature’s tail or the line of its back as it passes in the dark. I know now that Baba wanted to pick me up and wave me around like he used to do, to squeeze my face and check my teeth. I barely said hello, arms crossed over my t-shirt. All I wanted at that age was to disappear, but this stocky red-mustachioed man had showed up ready to experience America loudly. Over those weeks, he ate ice cream twice a day, counted the price of everything by the number of root canals it took to earn it, and his addictions endangered us more than once. We took him for Mexican food; he took one bite of guacamole and said, “Is taste like Nivea cream.” He asked me if I had learned to hold a cigarette like a lady, and he offered pistachios to the plumber.</p>
<p>At home, Baba looked around and nodded at the couch, grunting under his breath. “I’ll sleep here,” he said. “No need to trouble yourselves.” The apartment contained no notable signs of Nader, but it was tiny, with a half kitchen jutting into the living room and no dining room or foyer. The shared space consisted simply of a couch pushed up against a small window, a round Turkish coffee table, a television on a chipped cabinet with the glass missing, and two metal chairs with thin green cushions. All of this sat atop a horrid blue carpet that came with the apartment. The kitchen, though, was fully stocked with knives and woks and pots of many sizes because of stupid Nader and his obsession with frying and sautéing and marinating everything, always wearing his stupid headphones. A part of me wished he would show up here all shirtless and chain-smoking and blasting U2, so Baba could tell him he was a doofus and throw him out. Imagining that scene made me giggle and when Baba whipped around at the smallest sound of possible joy, I fixed my face into a frown again.</p>
<p>He placed his suitcase beside the couch and did a quarter turn, first one way, then the next. Then he turned back to Maman, and said in a voice that didn’t sound casual even to me, “Pari <em>joon</em>, can I use your phone?”</p>
<p>Maman stood behind the counter in the open kitchen, piling homemade cream puffs on a plate. “Why?” she said. A look of alarm passed over her face as she spoke. “Do you want to call Iran? It’s late there.”</p>
<p>“No,” he said, rummaging through his pocket. He stared at a scrap of paper for a moment and plunged his hand back into his pocket.</p>
<p>“Oh, no, no, no, Bahman,” said Maman, dropping a teaspoon and bursting into the living area. She spoke in a loud whisper, pushing the words out as if through a gap in her front teeth. “You won’t call any friends here. No friends, do you hear me? How did you even find someone?” He started to speak, but Maman interrupted. “That’s the end of it. No socializing.” She stormed back into the kitchen and started rewrapping the cream puffs as if she were punishing a toddler with no dessert. Her fingers shook as she worked, cream splattering, her pretty blouse staining. “We just got our green cards,” she muttered. “How can you be so foolish?”</p>
<p>Everything seemed weary and intense with Baba in the room. Even the harsh light through our single window drained me, though I had felt it and sat in it and used it to warm my legs every day for years. Sometimes in our earliest days, I used to sneak out of bed when Kian and Maman were asleep and stick my bare stomach against the glass. The heat was such a luxury. I pretended I was on a tropical island.</p>
<p>“Calm down, Pari <em>joo</em>n. Everything is fine,” said Baba. “No need to put those away.” He smiled wide at her, and at her pastries, with boyish contentment.</p>
<p>Maman stopped, her shoulders dropping, a small breath escaping. She looked at her hands, only now realizing that she was putting away the sweets she had spent all week baking. She unwrapped them again and placed them on the coffee table.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what had happened between them, of course. I was young and had no idea whom he wanted to call and why. Now I know many Iranians flung far from home, strangers turned friends by virtue of a single common trait. In their adopted cities, exiled Iranians have no more caretakers or errand boys to deliver their illegal indulgences. They learn how to make friends fast.</p>
<p>Late that night, after Kian and Maman had gone to bed, I found Baba on the phone. He sat cross-legged in his undershirt and pajama bottoms atop a bright-orange sleeping bag on a row of couch cushions that Maman had set up on the floor. Holding his glass of hot cardamom tea, his knees pulled in tight, he looked like a person sitting on a life raft, crouching low, trying to keep all his limbs in. He whispered in Farsi, and so my first thought was that he was making an expensive call to Iran against Maman’s wishes.</p>
<p>But after some nodding and a few approving grunts, he said, his accent thickening to the village drawl, “It’s an honor, Agha. . . What luck to have friends in faraway places. . . No, don’t speak of it. I’m your servant. Until tomorrow.” With that, he hung up. When he saw me watching, he called me to him. “Come here, <em>khanom</em> who looks like my daughter. Do you have any pictures to show your Baba? New ones?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. I didn’t move toward him, a comfortable old fear returning.</p>
<p>He said, “How is that possible?” and he threw up his hand in that single dismissive gesture that our people share with Italians and Spanish and all fiery people—not the Dutch. “In Iran, girls your age are addicted to photos. Your cousins, do you remember them? Your cousins sit around your grandmother’s living room and play with their Polaroid all afternoon. I brought some. Do you want to see?”</p>
<p>“I hate photos,” I said. Recently my Iranian nose had started to bloom, and my skin was oily and dark. Worse, my front teeth had come in crooked. The idea of Baba suggesting orthodontics terrified me. So, I added, “It’s vain and un-Christlike.”</p>
<p>“<em>Khak too saram</em>,” he said, <em>dirt on my head</em>. His eyes bulged like the science-class hamster after a long squeeze. “What the hell are you talking about, Niloo <em>joon</em>?”</p>
<p>I shrugged. He hauled himself off his haunches and turned on the television. Sitting beside the monitor, he changed the channels manually until he came to a trashy soap opera. He craned his neck toward Maman’s bedroom and, hearing no sign of wakefulness, he said, “See that woman there?” He pointed to a heavily made-up, coiffed, and sprayed woman in a halter top having an animated argument with a similarly adorned rival. I blushed at the sight of so much exposed American breast in Baba’s presence. But he didn’t seem to notice. He said, “I’d rather you grow up to be this useless to the universe than to become a religion pusher. If this disaster,&#8221;—he pointed to the lady, his fleshy finger in her face—&#8221;is absolute zero in value, then Jesus and Allah pushers are deep in the negatives. All this God business will mess you up, Niloo <em>joon</em>, and then it will kill you. And you won’t go anywhere after. Understand?”</p>
<p>I nodded, unaware of a profound confusion taking root. To Maman, Jesus was our family’s only remaining identity. He was our way out of Iran and the reason Kian and I would go to top American universities. Little else had mattered in Iran, but she was even more fervent here. Having lost her profession, her volunteer work, and her community, exiled in remotest Oklahoma, she lived only for Him. Her every decision had to be seen to serve her God—even the choice to partner with Nader, who was peripherally tied to the church, and, if you ask me, mostly in it for the community outings and sanctioned access to multicultural divorcées.</p>
<p>“If you want to find God,” said Baba, as he turned off the TV, “study the natural sciences. Earth, the human body, anything you can touch, or see traces of, or watch through a microscope. Then, if your spirit is still hungry, memorize poetry. That’s the only immortality available, Niloo <em>joon</em>, those voices from another time.” I didn’t argue, since his instructions didn’t seem to interfere with Maman’s faith. I could easily satisfy them both, so why bother trying to figure out who was right? “Did you know that in the old days, every Persian scholar was expected to write in verse? Half of Avicenna’s medical writings are in verse. There’s so much mystery and beauty in the physical world without resorting to fantasy and God worship.”</p>
<p>Rearranging himself on his raft, Baba said, “Go find some photos.” He picked up the receiver again and dialed from a number in his cupped palm. I hadn’t noticed the paper scrap nestled there. I asked whom he was calling, but he waved me away, muttering something about having to ask a hundred times for photos. I counted the number of digits he dialed—only seven. He wasn’t calling Iran. He wasn’t even calling Oklahoma City. Whoever his friend was, he was right here in our tiny suburb.</p>
<p>I went in search of my eighth-grade album. Maman had helped me cut photos of my friends and activities into fun shapes and paste them into a book along with colorful images from magazine ads (fruits and candies and things; no cosmetic or alcohol ads, even though they had the best graphics. I begged her to let me include a gorgeous lime wedge hanging off a dewy, crystalline vodka bottle. She scowled, horrified). My search must have taken a while, because when I returned to the living room, the strangest scene was unfolding. Baba was answering the front door in his pajamas, shaking hands with Nader.</p>
<p>I lingered in the hall, waiting for something to happen. Maman was in the deepest sleep. With two jobs and church, she slept every minute that didn’t lead directly to someone’s physical or spiritual feeding. Even if she had known that Nader and Baba were meeting now, she wouldn’t have wanted to be woken. The poor don’t get the luxury of fussing over awkwardness. They deal. So I stood in my turquoise socks, one foot on my thigh like an ostrich, my album tucked under my arm, waiting for someone to punch someone, like in the movies.</p>
<p>“Hey, kiddo,” Nader greeted me, slapping Baba’s back as he entered. I held my breath. Surely Baba would explode at this rude gesture from a man a hundred years younger than him. “Been practicing?” He was looking at the foot on my thigh. Sometimes while at the stove, Nader taught me yoga moves from his travels. We would raise our arms and sun-salute as we sautéed. Spatulas in our teeth, we would downward-dog. I had good balance and flexibility and I liked practicing the poses on my own. But now, I dropped my foot and said, “Don’t call me <em>kiddo</em>.” I added, glaring, “Baba, this is Maman’s friend, Nader.”</p>
<p>Nader wasn’t bothered. “Finally,” he said, “I meet the famous Dr. Hamidi. It’s an honor. Do you want a smoke, Doctor?”</p>
<p>“I don’t smoke tobacco,” said Baba coldly. Though he did; of course he did.</p>
<p>“Neither do I,” said Nader. Though he did, too. The man smoked for breakfast; what was he talking about?</p>
<p>“Oh, yes?” said Baba. “Fine then. Much obliged, Nader <em>joon.</em>” He reached for his shirt. Why was he <em>joon-</em>ing Nader? They were out the door in three minutes, Nader’s lanky body in a graying t-shirt gliding out after Baba’s lumpier, buttoned-up one.</p>
<p>Hours later, the men returned, all backslaps and darting eyeballs and dancing fingers. They didn’t come in, but circled the apartment and stood on the shared terrace out back, talking quietly. I watched them through the glass and once in a while caught a word here or there, nothing meaningful. What could they have to say to each other? I retrieved my picture album from the cushionless couch where I had left it, and I slipped out to the back. They didn’t notice me, and so I lingered, thinking that if I was caught I could use the album as an excuse—<em>Oh this? I’m</em> <em>not spying. Just wanting some father-daughter time.</em></p>
<p>An aside: Over the years in Amsterdam, I’ve studied Iranian fathers and daughters. Persian men belittle and abuse their wives, demanding total subservience. They insist on delectable suppers, sparkling floors, and clothes that smell of jasmine, all without fuss or complaint. Their mothers served them, after all, and they need it to survive, but they suffer an unconscious guilt over it. So, when chance gives them a daughter, a fear sets in. What if someone treats their hatchling the way they’ve treated their wives? They then sacrifice themselves to this precious creature. They become her practice field. They offer themselves as the ground holding her up, the shifting plates of their backs the terrain for her small feet. They teach their girls to be aggressive and cunning and to rule over them, to trick their fathers into buying presents, to bat their eyelashes and stomp on hearts, never to tell their own husbands, “I love you,” because that’s giving up too much power. Forced to witness this spectacle, frustrated wives (having once been someone’s muse and Machiavelli) spoil their sons, lavishing them with all the attention they lack from their husbands, teaching the next generation that a woman’s love is delivered never in words, only through service. The result of all this is generation after generation of entitled boy-men and brick-fisted, manipulative women, a dynamic that may offend the civilized, but is sustainable and self-propagating.</p>
<p>My Baba didn’t spoil me as other Babas did, but even he couldn’t escape this twisted kind of father-daughter love that garroted our social world. We saw it everywhere and it snared us too—a little. So, I waited by the door, eavesdropping for ten minutes before announcing myself. They were talking about Maman in Farsi, the story about Baba’s last days in Tehran University, when he would bring her berries and almonds from Ardestoon and hide them in her apartment with clues of their whereabouts, written entirely in verse. I knew this story.</p>
<p>“You were in love,” said Nader. “It’s a blessing.”</p>
<p>Baba scoffed. “Blessing,” he said. “A pretentious word. I was just lucky, like you. And I was open to it. In my gut, I was open to the thing.” Nader nodded; he never looked uncomfortable. Baba shrugged. “You’re a churchgoing man. You can call things blessings if you want. But I think everything is random, and I’m right.”</p>
<p>“You should come to church with us,” said Nader, taking three short drags of his cigarette. “I’ll make ribs after. We can have it with real rice, no sticky garbage.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Baba. Nothing more. They puffed in silence for a long while. Then Baba peered into the dark. “I imagine things aren’t so lonesome here,” he said, his back bent, his gaze on his shoe, “when you’re in a church.”</p>
<p>Nader nodded. “That’s true,” he said, “for the kids too.”</p>
<p>Baba scoffed, his voice straining. “But they’ve forgotten their home. I tried to talk about Ardestoon. No interest. And Niloo’s becoming a damn ascetic. She says she’s given up ice cream; did you know this?” I could see the annoyance in Baba’s eyes. As a child, I had seen him become violent, but the monster was so deeply buried now—what would cause it to emerge? Not Nader. Nader wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>“Is the wedding soon?” asked Nader, leaning over the fence that separated the shared terrace from a small grassy area. A small wave crested in my stomach. What <em>wedding soon</em>? Whose wedding? One of Baba’s sisters? My beloved Uncle Ali?</p>
<p>Baba shrugged. His voice was now gravelly and low; I struggled to hear. “It’s just talk,” he said. “She’s a simple woman, a villager; I’d almost rather hire her to do some light work. I don’t know what I’m saying. I’m sorry. I don’t want to upset Pari.”</p>
<p>“Pari is fine, <em>Agha</em> Doctor,” said Nader. “She’s complicated. An iron cage around that heart. A fortress. She’s impossible to hurt.”</p>
<p>“Impossible?” Baba smirked and shook his head at Nader, as if to say, <em>And you know Pari, do you?</em> He put out his cigarette. Seeing that he was about to turn toward the apartment, I jumped out, afraid of being caught spying.</p>
<p>“Baba, I brought pictures,” I said, holding the album on top of my head.</p>
<p>“Oh, Niloo, my Niloo,” he sang as he followed me inside. “What good instincts you have. I want to see every picture you’ve taken. Where are those cream puffs?” He turned and waved goodbye to Nader, who took a last puff, licked his teeth, and made his way around the apartment and back to his car.</p>
<p>The next night Baba disappeared. He didn’t say where he was going and he didn’t take much, just his leather satchel with his cash, IDs, and green prayer beads. (“For secular counting only,” he often said. “Is a tranquilizing, to count.”) He left before Maman returned from her second job at the pharmacy. When she found him missing, she muttered to herself and ransacked his belongings. She opened his suitcase without the slightest hesitation or guilt. She simply unzipped it, tossed aside shirts, rummaged through underwear and socks. When her hand grazed an inexplicable lump, she took out one of Nader’s steak knives and she punctured the lining of his expensive suitcase as if it were the plastic around an English cucumber. In those days, there were no airport scans of suitcases and manual searches were random and never took into account the fact that a crafty bon vivant with money and connections might have false linings sewn in. “Shameless, lying dog,” she whispered as she pulled out the cotton wrapped cans of Caspian caviar, the boxes of homemade sesame brittle, the used pipes with that dangerous pungent smell.</p>
<p>For hours she raged. When Baba returned at six in the morning, she was still awake, waiting in a kitchen chair, breaking off split ends with her fingernails, her precious sleep sacrificed to the promise of releasing her fury on his gingery gray head the instant his wandering foot touched her property.</p>
<p>She knew where he had gone. And he didn’t try to deny it—he had found an Iranian exile with a <em>manghal</em> and a willingness to trade hits for cash. He had gone to this new friend’s home, sat at his <em>sofreh</em> and reclined on his floor pillows, smoked and eaten and drunk with him, and offered his family a “gift” of pistachios or fruit leather or caviar from home. The family had demurred, practicing the Iranian art of <em>tarof</em>, refusing the gift until it was offered thrice. Finally they had accepted it, knowing all along how many fifty-dollar bills would be tucked inside.</p>
<p>It seemed they had even given him a place to sleep it off, because Baba looked unchanged to me—only tired. My parents fought for hours. There’s hardly any point in recounting the details. Maman felt used. He had taken advantage of her kindness again, and he had endangered his own children’s future—what about our green cards? What about the impression he was making on his daughter, who was already showing signs of wantonness?</p>
<p>By the time the hot Oklahoma sun had peaked, Baba was tossed out of our home. He moved into the Red Carpet Motel, a dingy, musty place with dark rooms arranged in a horseshoe pattern around a cratered parking lot. I insisted on accompanying Maman to drop him off. I never admitted my fear that he would leave and return to Iran, maybe stopping to wave goodbye to us through a window. Kian came too, but he stayed in the car with Maman while I helped Baba carry his bags into the room. The bed was on wheels, a thin white sheet covering the mattress and a single pillow. The sight of a Cheetos bag and tissues left in the trash can by the last resident (or a careless maid) saddened me and I turned to go, afraid my feelings would spill out. Baba exhaled loudly and kissed me goodbye. “Go, Niloo <em>joon</em>, we don’t want to make her madder.”</p>
<p>And so began two weeks of Baba trying to atone for his bad behavior by taking us on exciting American outings. Eight of those days were spent at a Western-themed water park called White Water Bay, a strange amalgam of hackneyed Americana, exploitative Cherokee kitsch, waterslides, surf motifs, and overpriced Tex-Mex. It was unclear whether the schizophrenic park thought it was in Oklahoma, Montana, California, or (to my bafflement even back then) someplace near a rain forest.</p>
<p>Baba discovered the park while watching television in his motel room that first night. I knew the commercial, a frenzy of water splashing at the camera lens, hard-bodied twenty-year-olds chugging diet sodas and tackling each other, and a neurostimulant of a song by the Surfaris that was basically some cackling and the word <em>wipeout</em> howled over and over in an echo chamber.</p>
<p>The first time Maman dropped us off in front of the ticket station, I just wanted the day to be done. Many of my middle-school classmates hung out at this water park. And here I was, after years of trying to seem American, arriving with my mustachioed father, his great cask of a belly blanketed in ginger fur, with his neon Persian-script trunks and a cigarette barely hanging on to his lips. He was a spectacle just stepping out of the car, even before he bellowed in the ticket line, in broken English, “This! Oh, watery paradise! Let us find proper verse for this day!”</p>
<p>“Let’s not,” I said in a threatening whisper. “Baba, stop it! I’m serious.”</p>
<p>“Stop what?” he said in loud Farsi, exhaling a long tendril of smoke.</p>
<p>“No more Farsi,” I said. “And do you have to talk so loud?”</p>
<p>Kian didn’t seem to care. “Can we go on the big slide first?”</p>
<p>“See, Niloo <em>joon</em>? Kian has it right,” said Baba, taking the longest drag and flicking his cigarette right into the next line. He had switched back to Farsi. “We live for us. Not for the watchers. Be free now that you’re in a free country.” He paid for our tickets with a wad of cash roughly the girth of two <em>Rubaiyat</em>s, and ignored the glare of the ticket taker as he lit another cigarette. On the way in, I’m pretty sure he gave one to a loitering teenager.</p>
<p>A few hours into the day, Baba, light-skinned and ginger, started to burn. He stood by our lounge chairs for ten minutes, rubbing lotion into his arms and legs with great care, leaving a white residue all over his body “for added protection.” Before I could rush off, he begged me to do his back. I wanted so much to run away, but his skin was flushed, even his knees a few shades redder. I hurried to lotion his back, looking around for classmates, but the sunscreen wouldn’t absorb. The thick layer of hair on Baba’s back was making it foam. “I’m done,” I said, and ran away to join Kian in the rapids, leaving Baba to fill his time alone.</p>
<p>Once or twice throughout the day, I spotted him ambling through the park, full of wonder in his straw hat and tangerine trunks.</p>
<p>Sometime later, Kian and I wandered to the Acapulco Cliff Dive, a monstrosity of a slide shaped much like a stretching basilisk, with a short initial drop, then a long, steep free fall that flattened out again near the end. When we arrived at the bottom of the ride, an athletic college boy was coming off the bottom, shaking and in turns swearing and cackling to himself.</p>
<p>“Wanna go on?” Kian asked, glancing at me quickly, then away again. I could tell he hoped he wouldn’t have to try this.</p>
<p>“I’m not getting in that line for a dumb slide,” I said, to spare him.</p>
<p>So we stood there and watched people barrel down. Two swim-team types later, a familiar shape took form at the top of the slide, which was so high the figures atop it were reduced to specks recognizable only by the color of their hats or t-shirts. But something about the gait of the person laboring to maneuver his bulbous body, basted in white, into starting position caught both of us unprepared. Kian looked at me, his brown eyes, already round as coins, widening. Then, before we could exchange two words, his body came thumping and slapping down as he screamed in ecstasy and abandon and fear, “Oh, great God,” again and again in Farsi.</p>
<p>He waved at us as he picked himself up from the landing pool. Then, striding past us as if we were ungrateful traitors and not his impressionable adolescent offspring, he said, “That slide is like a shot of liquor from a Rashti bathtub!” He pounded his gleaming lotion-white chest and strode off to get in line again.</p>
<p>The water park transported him, maybe in a way similar to his opium.</p>
<p>Baba enjoyed American life in deafening fashion, sliding down the Cliff Dive and eating too much ice cream, and going to visit his new “friends” somewhere we weren’t allowed to know. I’m glad now that he enjoyed it, because he never got another American visa. He got kicked out of the park twice for smoking in restricted areas and for giving out cigarettes to his “staff” of wayward boys, teenagers who fetched his candy and stood in lines for him in return for the smokes. (I spent a lot of time hiding with a book in the changing rooms.) After each eviction, he got back in by bribing the management from his gargantuan bundle of cash.</p>
<p>And so it went, in the sticky heat, until the afternoon I walked from a church-camp meeting to the Red Carpet Motel, thinking I would surprise him.</p>
<p>When I knocked, the door gave way. It had been closed hastily and hadn’t clicked shut. So I went in, cheerfully calling, “Baba <em>joon</em>, I’m here.” He had been with us for weeks, and I knew in the privacy of my heart that he would stay for good. Each time he joked with Maman, I grew more convinced. Being around him was becoming easier too, and I was forgetting to fear for my teeth.</p>
<p>The room was dark, though it was midday. The window was sealed shut and sodden towels covered all the cracks. The room smelled so awful, I had to breathe into my hand. The bed and the floor beside it were covered in photographs—his childhood with his mother in old village garb, his first days at Tehran University, black-and-whites of relatives from decades ago, a picnic in an orchard, then with Maman in Ardestoon in their early marriage<em>,</em> the family at the dinner table in our house in Isfahan, me and Kian as babies, and even some Oklahoma photos he had obviously stolen from my album. I ran a hand through them, looking for recent photos of Uncle Ali, but found none of Baba’s current life. I didn’t hear any noises from the bathroom and, though to an adult the scene would have been transparent, I just thought he had gone out to get some ice cream. He was obsessed with the astonishing array of American ice-cream flavors—butter (butter!), pecan and rum (rum!), raisin and cappuccino chunky chocolate.</p>
<p>I unlatched the window, gathered the wet towels, and went to the bathroom, thinking I would discard them in the tub. I pushed open the bathroom door, and he was there, on the closed toilet lid. He wasn’t sitting exactly, but slumped, his familiar white undershirt and pajama pants soaked in sweat. His knees were far apart, his hands hanging over them, twitching now and then, his head between his legs so that his silky youthful hair clung to his forearms, like moss against a rock.</p>
<p>He must have sensed me there, because he tried to raise his head. But it lay heavily by his thigh. I heard several deep breaths, efforts at breath. I said, “Baba,” and he finally managed it. He lifted his gaze and studied me, as one might study a stranger. I waited for him to smile, to say, <em>Hello,</em> <em>Niloo</em>, but his stare was so long, so dark and terrible, so empty of reason and memory, but somehow not devoid of feeling. Though he didn’t believe in heaven or hell or God or demons, wherever Baba was, it was otherworldly. Behind his glare was something raw and unprocessed, animal. Not hate exactly, though people who hate often have that look. It was terror.</p>
<p>After a swallow, he whispered something, in slow, croaking syllables. But a gale of other sounds overpowered his words. The trickle of water in the tub, this sweaty stranger’s pained breath, the screaming construction outside; these sounds rushed my ears instead. He reached for a box of tissues, but his hand trembled around it, near it, over it. Then he looked at me and asked for it, “Niloo <em>joon</em>. . . tissues.” But I couldn’t. He tried to hold on to a towel rod, his hand slipping twice, but I didn’t rush to help him. This was the man who, not so long ago, had carried me on his shoulders, whose fleshy back had been the ground.</p>
<p>All I could think to do was run away, leaving him there to recover or not.</p>
<p>The next day, as he gathered his bags for the airport and explained to Kian and me that his return flight had always been arranged for today (hadn’t he told us before? he was sure he had), I didn’t argue. He said, “Sweet Niloo, you know I can’t stay forever.” I hated him, not just for this, but because he had forgotten the previous night, my presence in the motel room. And though this was the first time he confessed breaking his promise to me (“I can’t stay forever”), I already knew. It was obvious in that motel bathroom that he had chosen to live away from me, that there was something he loved more: not poetry or medicine or family, but oblivion.</p>
<p>I often wondered how pleasurable it could be, and growing up, I asked Maman to describe his delirium to me. She said a few words about the bliss of it, the feeling of complete cohesion with the universe, but mostly she talked about the agony of withdrawal, the sweating, vomiting, and chattering teeth. She talked about her two attempts to cure him, locking him in the house for weeks, feeding and bathing him, bringing him music and books. The first time, he snuck out. The second time, he was so desperate for a <em>manghal</em>, so consumed by this creature need to be released, to chew off his ties and go hunt for it, that he chased her to the shallow end of our empty pool and beat her with a garden hose until she gave him the keys.</p>
<p>Though I’ve seen Baba three more times since Oklahoma, I can’t imagine how he lives now. Do his days look like mine, reading trade journals at his desk, stopping at the bakery and cobbler on the way home? Or does he spend his days under a leafy canopy in Ardestoon? Does he lie to his new wife? Does she watch for that moment when her clever, joyful husband might transform into something beastly? Nowadays in Amsterdam, a first puff of weed or hashish carries me to that motel with him, but I don’t dare try opium. My work offers me oblivion. Often I wonder, what is this urge to set off alone toward some imagined home? Have I inherited it? It must be the way the wanderer endures, a survival instinct from our earliest days. I try to picture it in aggregate—every day across the world, how many wretched travelers crouch in grimy bathrooms, searching for a way to explain that they can’t stay?</p>
<p>Every person has a dozen hidden faces. My memories tell me that Baba’s Oklahoma visit was a hedonist’s manic dash through a permissive, bountiful country, a brief pleasure hunt. I was too young then to see the sadness in his eyes when I crossed my arms and looked away, when I didn’t help him off that bathroom floor, and on our final day, when I hardly said goodbye. I see it now in photos, his arm perched awkwardly on my shoulder as I shifted my weight the other way.</p>

The series of self-portraits explore the artist&#8217;s relationship to their father, a convicted pedophile, after he died in prison. The images were exhibited as part of a weekend-long collaboration between Aperture, the Ackerman Institute for the Family, and The Voices and Faces Project. The program presented an intersectional approach to art making and storytelling as vehicles to address gender-based violence and trauma, and to create social change. The following is an edited transcript from the panel discussion on Tuesday, May 23, among Lois Braverman, a therapist and president of the Ackerman Institute for the Family; Mila Zuo, a film-maker and feminist scholar; and artist Rowan Renee. The panel explores cultural narratives of gender-based violence and victimhood, the complexities of reclaiming pleasures that are intrinsically connected to pain, and the repositioning of incest and other forms of childhood abuse as a structural problem that occurs within the family institution.</p>
<p><strong>Rowan Renee: </strong>I&#8217;ll start with a big question. Mila, do you think cultural narratives about gender influence us when dealing with trauma? Our culture narrates that women who are abused become victims and men that are abused become perpetrators. How is that damaging or flattening to our experience?</p>
<p><strong>Mila Zuo:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question. Despite the quantitative research about gender-based violence, which we should take into account, the narratives that get told about women being victims and men being perpetrators pass on a reductive story and a certain performativity of gender roles. It doesn&#8217;t allow for complications to arise when anecdotal evidence or other events disprove gender expectations.</p>
<p>One idea that feminist and queer theory brings to the conversation is how to think beyond the binary. Not only the male-female binary, but the pleasure-pain binary and the victim-perpetrator binary. To collapse those positions engages us in a more nuanced understanding of what it means to claim agency and power from the “victim” position. When we open up the ways we think about trauma and victimhood, for instance, we can let in something like pleasure as a possibility for healing and belonging. What do we gain when we think beyond pathos as the sole affective position from which someone can listen to another’s experience with violence? Pathos can have diminishing or othering effects that shut down curiosity and conversation. Related to this, the cultural scholar Sara Ahmed writes about wonder as a feminist affect that enables us to see and validate another’s pain, not <em>because </em>we know what it’s like to be that person, but precisely because we <em>cannot</em> know. In a way, this idea unsettles the concept of empathy, which has largely been couched in a kind of narcissistic or self-possessed understanding. So, this concept helps us rethink not only the “victim’s” position, but also that of the listener or receiver.</p>
<p>Although statistical evidence points to more perpetration of violence by men than women, we also need think about the ways in which we narrativize, and in turn unwittingly justify, a certain inevitability between maleness and violence. This kind of story not only flattens our experience; it also <em>prescribes</em> gender “normative” behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Rowan Renee: </strong>I&#8217;m attracted to the idea of claiming power from the position of victim because it&#8217;s so stigmatized. The narrative says that once you become a victim you are damaged. That’s not fair. Many of us are victims of many different kinds of violence. We all have to function in society, and most of us manage on an everyday basis. It&#8217;s a small percentage of victims that have gone into a deeper state of distress. I think it&#8217;s important to resist the shame attached to victimhood. Mila, I remember you had some interesting things to say about queerness and shame.</p>
<p><strong>Mila Zuo:</strong> I&#8217;m thinking of the work of Ann Cvetkovich, Sara Ahmed, and Leo Bersani, for example. These queer theorists take a position of anti-normativity. They call into question the normative as socially constructed, because the “normative” lacks a stable or universal set of values. To depathologize victimhood or trauma in a way where we can start talking about it would mean to regard trauma as an institutional phenomenon. There are individual instances of it, but thinking laterally about trauma, it is enacted as a social institution in various ways in global capitalism. What you&#8217;ve been saying is to think more openly about trauma as a modality that&#8217;s not<em> just </em>personal, <em>but also</em> personal.</p>
<p>What you just said about resisting shame is also important. The shame that becomes attached to individuals is a stigma that manifests as silence. That silence fixes those individuals in place. It’s immobilizing. Just like other urgent and pressing issues that become perceived as blemishes to our society, our immediate impulse is to ignore them and cover them up. Then it becomes a wound that isn’t allowed to heal, a Freudian repression that continues to reconstitute in various ways. That’s why we see a fascination with trauma and spectacles of violence in cultural production and within fictional realms, but rarely do we have honest and complicated conversations about violence as a society. But what if it’s the people who have actually experienced trauma who can offer us new and important ways of knowing the world? Likewise, how might we rethink violent perpetrators and the ways in which they re-produce larger systems of oppressive power and authority within the domestic domain—not to diminish the domestic realm, but to elevate the everyday as the space wherein larger structural violence and trauma are echoed and recreated between individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Rowan Renee: </strong>Typically, incest is too taboo to even mention. I read somewhere that back in the 1950s it was believed that one in one million people had experienced it. The psychotherapist writing this book went on to postulate: “Well, then why are 50 of the 100 supposed victims in the United States in my practice?” Even though I’ve had trouble finding accurate statistics for incest<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>RAINN and CDC conflict<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>the actual numbers are shockingly high. There&#8217;s a special discrepancy about male victims, which merits further thought. Incest is often positioned as a women&#8217;s issue and that leaves out the existence of male victims, especially straight male victims, who are even more stigmatized than women in seeking resources. So, where do these men learn to deal with their pain? The narrative of normative masculinity expects men to act out their trauma through perpetuating violence. It is not helpful for us to leave out men when discussing how to break the cycle of violence.</p>
<p><strong>Lois Braverman: </strong>At the Ackerman Institute, we work from the idea that you are more than your bad act and you are more than what was acted upon you. We probably wouldn&#8217;t use the word victim, because people are complex. Even in your photos, you represent a complicated experience of pain and pleasure, and beauty and ugliness. You don&#8217;t want your experience to be limited by any dominant narrative. I&#8217;m wondering about the photo that&#8217;s on the screen now. Do you think it represents your intent to push the narrative about victimhood and perpetration?</p>

<strong>Rowan Renee:</strong> For me, this image is more about the dissolution or fragmentation of the body over a landscape.</p>
<p>I produced this work in about four weeks when I was on a residency in Sausalito. I would go on long walks through the Marin Headlands. The flags were something I found one day while walking in the woods.</p>
<p>In this image, and others, I would first set up my camera and then take off my clothes. Because I was working in public spaces, the threat of being discovered lent these images a precarious language that wouldn&#8217;t have been there if I had permission to work in these locations. I used exhibitionism as a tool to implicate the potential for violence in the scene. That&#8217;s one reason why I consider these images solitary performances. The actions to make them were ritualized. I would undress over and over again, trying to capture on film the emotions that were recorded in my body. It was a way to tell a story that couldn&#8217;t be told because there were no words for it. Instead I simulated the feelings of danger and vulnerability, which ultimately meant taking real risks. The camera was my witness. My photographic process mirrored the detachment and fragmentation of memory that develops as a coping mechanism for trauma. Since I have a Yashica twin-lens camera, and I wasn&#8217;t using any digital assist, I couldn&#8217;t see myself in the frame or preview the scene with my body in it. I stepped into the frame, took the photo with a remote release, and sent away the film. A week later I&#8217;d find out how the shots came out. At such a distance, it&#8217;s easier to find meaning within the incoherence of violence.</p>
<p><strong>Mila Zuo:</strong> In many of the pictures it looks like you&#8217;re either holding on to something or being held by something. Was that an intentional gesture representative of holding onto the past?</p>

<p><strong>Rowan Renee:</strong> I reflect on my childhood as being bound. Children don&#8217;t have the freedom to leave if something is wrong. They&#8217;re stuck. I went through a period of being angsty because I wasn&#8217;t conscious of what was wrong. The dysfunction in my family was so normalized it was difficult to recognize. As a child, you cannot see other possibilities so you don&#8217;t know your experience is not normal.</p>
<p><strong>Mila Zuo:</strong> I noticed most of the photos were taken during the daytime. There&#8217;s an effervescence coming from the brilliance of the light, even though there&#8217;s an undertone of being bound that alludes to you dealing with trauma. Was it a conscious decision to not shoot in the dark?</p>
<p><strong>Rowan Renee:</strong> There are some technological limitations that played a role. For example, my camera didn&#8217;t have a flash, but that&#8217;s an easy answer. Conceptually speaking, familial violence happens so obviously. Imagery that is moody and noir is what people probably expect. But, trauma happens in the light. People see it and are indifferent to it. There&#8217;s an elaborate process of self-deception within families to be complicit to violence. It&#8217;s a normal faculty of the human mind. And it&#8217;s something we all need to resist. Lois, I have a question for you: What is considered healing in the therapeutic context? What are the steps to healing, and do you think there&#8217;s any relationship between art or creative expression and the healing process?</p>
<p><strong>Lois Braverman:</strong> So, there are three questions there. At the Institute, part of healing is to feel deeply understood by other family members so you can better deal with whatever challenges or constraints you face, whether it&#8217;s mental health issues or certain symptoms. Part of telling your story is feeling compassionately and deeply heard. Not just by the therapist, but by other family members, so that there can be, in some circumstances, amends or an apology. Also, so that the child can be made to feel safe and protected. The extent of the family’s complicity changes once the story is out. There are real things families can do to help the healing process, both for the child and so individual family members can deal with their own not-knowing and realizing, <em>Oh-my-gosh that&#8217;s what was happening, and I just didn&#8217;t want to see it</em>. The parent who is non-offending and the child who has been abused both have to undergo the healing process. There is a way to heal, and being able to do that in the context of family members is strengthening. That was the first part of your question.</p>
<p>There are many ways to move through a healing process. Art is certainly one. We see people do it through writing plays, comedy acts and drawing. There are all kinds of ways to metabolize and make sense of our experience. We illuminate it and that allows other people to see us. For me, your photographs are a way for your experience to be heard, although it&#8217;s being seen. Witnessing is part of the process of healing.</p>
<p><strong>Rowan Renee:</strong> This has me thinking about silence and speaking. The shame around incest and sexual violence delays the healing process. If trauma can&#8217;t be addressed when it occurs, living with it in silence amplifies the effects. It sounds like you think of communication and healing as related. Communication is the base of building intimate bonds.</p>
<p><strong>Lois Braverman:</strong> Exactly. When you feel that your experience is being heard and understood by your mother, or your sister, or your brother, or another family member, you are actually held in a new way. It&#8217;s different than going through years of holding onto a secret.</p>
<p><strong>Mila Zuo:</strong> I was just thinking about that question in terms of invisibility and visibility. From the perspective of your pictures, you play with being seen and unseen throughout the work. For instance, in the frames where there&#8217;s fabric obscuring the foreground, there&#8217;s something being said about invisibility. You also do this with showing your face and not showing your face. It creates a real desire for the viewer to see the face. And we are deprived of it. The absence generates <em>jouissance</em>, a pleasurable pain or a painful pleasure, within the frame.</p>
<p><strong>Rowan Renee: </strong>There&#8217;s a relationship between silence and invisibility that has wider implications culturally. It reminds me of a position I read in <em>Conflict is Not Abuse</em>, Sarah Schulman’s latest book, which asserts that any kind of sustained violence has the goal of controlling behavior. All of the systems of oppression within capitalism, patriarchy, and white supremacy are implementing violence in different ways, but to the same end of dominance. The way it happens within a family works similarly<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>the acts elevate a particular person to a position of power over someone else. The family mirrors society at large. That&#8217;s where I went with it.</p>
<p><strong>Mila Zuo:</strong> I think that&#8217;s really generative. There are scholars working with the idea of trauma as an abstract concept that structures more relationships than just those within the family. Perhaps, the family formation is just reproducing something systemic.</p>

Her new novel, <em>Before Everything</em> (Viking, June 2017), catalogues the lives of five women<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>from their adolescence to one of their deaths<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>in short, syncopated sections that jump back and forth in time and point of view. The architecture of Redel’s often lyrical prose soars beyond ambition and signals the arrival of a true master. The book’s short, blunt sentences thrust us into the “ongoingness” of a scene, to enlarge a fleeting moment and make us examine it. “Something flashed blue. A wing, blue. A jay?”</p>
<p>These five women have marriages and lovers and hosts of admirers and friends. However, their relationships, as women and confidants, define them. A quiet yet revolutionary statement is at work in the warmth and depth of Redel’s pages about the not-so-subtle strength demanded of womanhood. The book lifts the veil on the power dynamics of female relationships<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>investigating the lasting power of allegiances of the heart. “This is what they had always done together,” Redel says of how they talk and listen to each other. “The necessity of saying it out loud. Talking for the sheer pleasure, the hilarity. To be witness to the stunning accumulation of a life.”</p>
<p>We don’t simply look to fiction as a place to escape, but a place to admire, to learn. Here, we are afforded the pleasure of all three. Redel grafts herself with swift and subtle assurance onto the readerly unconscious; it is an honor and a pleasure to be immersed amongst the lives of these women. To watch Redel pay homage to their strength, their humor, their complexity, their intelligence. The many roles they juggle both in the family and the larger sphere of the world. Below we discussed: How does one sculpt such a thing?</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>Annie DeWitt for </em>Guernica</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong><em>Before Everything</em> is a large trove of a novel, packed with wisdom about life and death and the unending curve of marriages and friendships, their shift and flow, the places they betray and bolster. I wondered if you might talk a bit about form. The word that comes to mind is bricolage. How did you conceive of this myriad patchworking together of lives?</p>
<p><strong>Victoria Redel:</strong> I was emerging from a big loss, the death of my best and oldest friend and began writing because it’s my way to manage experience and gives me a sense of purpose. The writing, at first, was about actual people. The scenes<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>I don’t know if you could call them scenes, sometimes just a moment, a thought someone was thinking, a glass lifted to lips for a sip of water<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>came up organically. Soon that shifted into fiction with fictional characters. Then a shape began emerging. Theodore Roethke has a line in his poem “The Waking” that reads: “We learn by going where we have to go.” That seems true of many things, certainly of writing. I began to understand that if the novel warranted including so many characters, then I needed to give them the opportunity. Originally I hadn’t conceived of a novel that shifts between many points of view. That would have been too scary. The architecture built slowly. It kind of dilated<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>layering in scenes, shifting the point of view inside a scene by reentering it, maybe just a moment later, through a different character. Because much of the foreground story happens in one house, having a less linear, mosaic architecture allowed for the situation of the novel to expand in multiple directions at once while the short bursts, its mosaic pieces, let me have the compression of a poem inside a novel.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> I found myself falling in with the women characters, loving them, as though I too had known them forever. You capture the ordinary nature of life and death in achingly honest, plainspoken terms. And yet, you elevate the mundane in a way that reminds me of Sharon Olds’s work. Your attention to the detail of the natural world as well as interior emotion create a synergy that made me feel as though I too lived among these people, was privy to their darkest secrets. How did you go about conceiving the details of each of these women&#8217;s narrative arcs? Helen the famous artist; Ming and her law practice; Caroline and her wild manic sister; Molly the therapist dealing with her teenage daughter&#8217;s rebellion; and Anna, who seems to hold the group together?</p>
<p><strong>Victoria Redel:</strong> You live long enough and listen to enough people [tell you their] big and the small problems, the secrets and the happiness, and you see that there’s no shortage of complexity in every person. The key in any novel, in any effective writing, is to select details that are distinct and still echo between characters. Flannery O’Connor says, &#8220;The fact is that the materials of the fiction writer are the humblest. Fiction is about everything human and we are made out of dust, and if you scorn getting yourself dusty, then you shouldn&#8217;t try to write fiction.” That seems exactly right. This attention to thingness, the physical world, creates character. Precision of observation becomes the way we can move inside how a character experiences the world. What any character notices, smells, hears is probably more telling and more reliable than what they say or what they feel.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>Hannah Tinti writes, &#8220;Victoria Redel bears witness to a remarkable group of women, effortlessly weaving back and forth through time, each thread revealing the cracks and secrets of their complex lives while also drawing them closer&#8230;. She proves that female friendship is the quiet, steady engine that truly runs the world.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t agree more. Each of these women struck me as a powerhouse in her own way. I wanted to ask them so many questions about my own life<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>am I doing it right? There seems to be a quiet feminism afoot here.</p>
<p><strong>Victoria Redel:</strong> The lives of ordinary women are not written about nearly enough. And there’s nothing ordinary about those lives. I detest when people say women are multitaskers as if what women have done through all of time is something new, created out of a business-efficiency model. It’s been my ambition always to allow women characters the whole big range—sexual, intellectual, emotional, maternal, furious, funny, loyal, determined, frustrated. I could keep adding to the list<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>tough, fierce, fearful, brilliant. The women I know are all of this and then some. I’m tired of simple dualities. And yes, feminist. Of course, feminist. I’m the youngest of three sisters. Our mother was an intense woman. She was a ballet dancer and created a large ballet school. She worked every day. Our grandmother lived till she was one hundred and three, through three centuries, many wars and countries, and was a feminist, though I don’t think she knew that word.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>This book dismisses the cliché of women as necessary enemies fighting for the male gaze. In fact, their friendships, rather than their marriages, or even their children, seem to fuel them. I wondered if you might talk about how you claimed that power?</p>
<p><strong>Victoria Redel:</strong> It wasn’t a power that needed to be claimed. It’s truly how I feel. I don’t buy any image of women as enemies or inevitably bitchy. Are women angry or ambitious? Yes, sometimes—and why shouldn’t they be? Maybe men believe our primary focus is the male gaze, but what woman in the midst of her life would agree? It is part of an oversimplified portrayal of women that has nothing to do with women’s actual lives. The women in <em>Before Everything</em> have been one another’s close confidantes over many years. They bear one another’s contradictions, they speak up to one another, and they show up for each other. I don’t think this is exceptional, and not only among intimate friends. Hasn’t every woman had the experience of walking into a public bathroom—let’s say at highway rest stop—and some woman washing her hands next to you says the most personal revealing statement? Maybe she looks up and catches your eye in the mirror, says, “Whoa, when did I start looking like my mother?” Or she might say, “I might have to kill my husband and my kids before this road trip is over.” And you nod and laugh, “I know. I know.” You say, “I’ve already killed mine three times this summer.” And then you both dry your hands and walk out feeling a lot better.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> What struck me most was that the relationship between the narrator and Anna was, in some ways, the most significant relationship of both of these women’s lives. I couldn&#8217;t help but cheer as you quietly upended traditional ideas of marriage and heteronormativity and was reminded of Michael Cunningham&#8217;s <em>A Home At The End of The World</em>, where a nontraditional group of three friends live as roommates and both men play father roles to the woman&#8217;s child. However, where Cunningham&#8217;s book uses first-person to explore these internal perspectives, you chose to use close third. I wondered if you might talk about that decision. It allows your narrative voice to remain constant, and yet the close third dips into the various characters&#8217; lives, creating a kind of kaleidoscopic interiority<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Victoria Redel:</strong> I believe in the power of women’s friendships. <em>Before Everything</em> is an opportunity to go as far into that power as I can. By creating a multiplicity of perspectives, I could keep reaching further inside the great family that friendship constructs. I think you’re right that this is one of Michael Cunningham’s great subjects. We have the family we are born into, and then we have the family we make over a lifetime. Maybe a couple of families. And we count on those families, those networks of love and strength. Is this revolutionary? It seems natural, healthy, and inevitable. In <em>Before Everything,</em> Reuben is such an important character to me. He’s not one of the women friends, though they all love him. He’s not really Anna’s husband anymore, but he steps up. Like the women, he loves through time, he understands that love is an action and that even though his marriage to Anna has in some fashion failed, he’s true to her and to the full spectrum of their life.</p>
<p>Using your terrific word, &#8220;kaleidoscopic,&#8221; close third gave me the opportunity to keep kaleidoscopically turning through these various characters’ interiorities and, hopefully, still manage a coherent music overall. I often built the narrative in only paragraph-long sections. Maybe in all of eight sentences, Caroline looks over at Reuben who is cleaning out the fridge, and she thinks about the suffering of caregivers. And then in the next section<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>which might be two pages long<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span> Reuben fantasizes about getting out on his bike, pushing himself to a physical brink. So there are quick shifts from one interiority to another interiority and then there are long sections, and I hoped third-person provided overall unity. I was trying for an orchestral effect. It was a serious challenge and I worried a lot. I wanted to keep moving through time and people, I wanted to allow for longer swaths of narrative and then for swifts, even abrupt ones. But I didn’t want to lose the reader. I am never looking to lose the reader. That was the challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>Anna is a very honest person. She doesn&#8217;t take any bullshit from anyone, even from her disease. She takes charge of orchestrating her own death. Her death becomes the central question around which the book is organized. In that way, there is a fugue-like structure to these various characters’ responses to mortality, which they examine through the lens of Anna&#8217;s choice not to continue treatment. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel as though this portrait was an homage to a life you&#8217;d observed. Is that what it is to take claim of life<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>to decide for yourself how it ends?</p>
<p><strong>Victoria Redel:</strong> If we are lucky, we can make choices that feel right for ourselves. And those choices really differ person to person. We all have such different thresholds of what is acceptable for a life. I’ve had several very dear friends and family die<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>some in long, protracted ways, some shockingly fast. We don’t always have the chance to choose how we’ll leave this earth but making decisions, facing our mortality, is brave. I wasn’t trying to make a prescription, but to honor a person’s choice and how that choice is borne by others.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>Your sentences in <em>Before Everything</em>, as in all your work, are exquisite. Short, blunt. I was reminded of a lecture you taught at Columbia where you said words were mathematical sets—when you use one word, you have access to all the subsets (and opposite subsets) within it and, in fact, have a responsibility to that awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Victoria Redel:</strong> I’ve got to say, no shortage of people will howl with laughter at the idea that I spoke about mathematics. But though I might not have grasped higher math, I really did love sets and subsets, what I now think is taught as Venn diagrams. That’s about third-grade math. But as you know<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>what I meant was that each word has a fuller implicative load. Every word comes with the possibility of its associational words, its opposites, it sonic twins, its vowel patterns. It’s all part of what helps create the language, voice, themes, the fabric of the novel. The specific words govern what actually happens in the book. I’ve often wished I could be a writer who tears through a rough draft. I know many great writers who do, and their attention to each word comes much later in the process. I write with a belief that each word, each sentence, gives me the possibility of what comes next. I’ve come full circle to Roethke’s “We learn by going where we have to go.” What a beautiful villanelle. So full of paradox. Quite mystical.</p>

Here was a woman I admired so acutely, in a body I wasn’t expecting, a body that in some ways looked like mine. The intersection of these realizations—that I hadn’t expected her to be fat, that I was so moved and excited that she was, that internalized fatphobia has such incredible power—surprised and disturbed me.</p>
<p>As a fat writer, I have always been aware of how rarely I see other fat writers. As with so many other categories of identity—race, gender, sexual orientation—that lack of visibility is very much at odds with the makeup of the general population. Folks are often surprised when I make this point. They express disbelief that fatness (a word they seem uncomfortable saying, or even alluding to) is any kind of obstacle to being a writer. On the surface, this makes sense: Pages look the same no matter what the author weighs, right? Why should it matter?</p>
<p>Yet we see, all the time, the ways it <em>does </em>matter. Last summer, Claudia Herr, then an editor at Knopf, casually told <a href="http://ew.com/article/2016/05/02/debut-novel-millions/"><em>Entertainment Weekly</em></a> that publishers think about certain factors unrelated to talent before they drop comically massive advances on debut authors. Discussing Knopf’s acquisition of Stephanie Danler’s novel <em>Sweetbitter</em>, Herr acknowledged that the way an author looks <em>can</em> affect an advance. “We look at all of that stuff,” she said. But: “We would have paid her the same money if she weighed five hundred pounds and was really hard to look at. That’s my firm belief.”</p>
<p>There’s so much in that comment: the fact that an editor at a major house felt comfortable saying that out loud, the fact that she thinks a very fat person would be “hard to look at,” her confessing that publishers consider an author’s appearance before hastily contradicting herself with what she presents as a hyperbolic scenario. (As Mallory Ortberg <a href="http://the-toast.net/2016/05/03/we-would-have-paid-her-the-same-if-she-weighed-500-pounds-publishing-and-writers-who-are-hard-to-look-at/">wrote</a> in response at <em>The Toast</em>, “‘We’d have bought this book EVEN IF—I don’t know—the writer were 500 pounds, as if that could ever happen.’ But that could, and does, happen! People of that size both exist and write. They sometimes write tremendous and valuable things.”)</p>
<p>Roxane Gay’s new book, <em>Hunger</em>, is a tremendous and valuable thing: a relentless, shattering exploration of Gay’s appetite for both food and control. Part memoir, part cultural criticism, it reads like a thematically linked essay collection that someone took a fist to. But while the book’s form is fragmented, as a work it is utterly complete. In short, stinging chapters, Gay traces her fatness back to a childhood gang rape and the resulting emotional aftermath, and meditates on themes of trauma, fear, and power.</p>
<p>When she’s not reflecting on her own life, Gay is pointing at broader uncomfortable truths about bodies: That society openly prefers one kind of eating disorder (anorexia) over another (binge eating) because we value thinness over all things. That there are stratums of privilege even within fat communities. (If you didn’t know the expression “Lane Bryant fat” before, you will now.) That even famous, wealthy women don’t get to just <em>be</em> in their bodies. She explores the taxonomy of fatness, the way it creates fear and anxiety in thin people, and addresses the fat body as liminal state: both a reflection of the past and something to be corrected in the future, never permitting its owner to simply exist. Even Gay’s publicity tour for her book about her fat body simply existing in the world has been met with obliviousness and insult. The host of a podcast in Australia wondered if Gay, on her way to be interviewed, would be able to fit into an elevator.</p>
<p>Gay is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of several books, including the story collections <em>Ayiti </em>and <em>Difficult Women</em>, the essay collection <em>Bad Feminist</em>, and the novel <em>An Untamed State. </em>With the poet Yona Harvey, she co-authored the <em>World of Wakanda</em> series (a spin-off of <em>Black Panther)</em> for Marvel. She is a contributing opinion writer for the <em>New York Times</em> and an associate professor at Purdue University.</p>
<p>Fat writing has been undergoing a kind of renaissance over the past few years, but Gay’s profile shoots her latest book, and all its uneasy truths and contradictions, straight into the center of the conversation. Maybe it will make fat writers that much harder to ignore. In early June, she and I talked on the phone about the beauty of unruly bodies, overlapping oppressions, and why everyone thinks they’re a health expert when it comes to fat people.</p>
<p><em>—Carmen Maria Machado for </em>Guernica</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>I’ve read <em>Hunger</em> twice now, and I’m just blown away and devastated by it. You’ve described the process of writing it as the most difficult of your life, and more challenging than you could have imagined. I’m wondering why you chose this time in your life and career to work on this book in particular. What made you arrive at this finished project?</p>
<p><strong>Roxane Gay: </strong>My agent and I proposed and sold the book just before <em>Bad Feminist</em> came out, so it’s been in the works for a while. At the time, I was thinking about what my next nonfiction project was going to be and I thought, “The thing I want to write about the least is fatness.” In that moment I knew the thing I needed to write about the most was fatness. Because it was something I was dreading.</p>
<p>I thought a lot about how so many memoirs about fatness focus on weight loss; they don’t focus on <em>living</em> with weight in a world that is rather inhospitable to it. So I knew that was the idea that was going to be most interesting and most challenging, and I like to be challenged as a writer.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>You use the term “unruly bodies” a lot in this book. It’s almost an incantation. There is something very tender about that phrase; it’s exasperated but affectionate. How did you happen upon that idea? What does it really means to have an “unruly body”?</p>
<p><strong>Roxane Gay: </strong>One of the things I was trying to do was define a more generous and positive way to talk about fat bodies. And I have an affection for unruliness and rule-breaking.</p>
<p>I did not originate the phrase. I first got it from a writer named Hanne Blank. I liked it because in a world that is always trying to discipline our bodies, as a fat person you are being unruly. And there’s definitely tenderness there, absolutely. Because Lord knows our bodies do not get discussed with a lot of tenderness.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>Throughout the book, hunger is a sort of wandering metaphor—a kind of hollowness that can be satisfied in some ways and not others, and is both created and fulfilled. Do you think hunger is a natural state of being for some people? For certain types of people?</p>
<p><strong>Roxane Gay: </strong>I think hunger is a natural state of being for most people. I mean, hunger is a desire—and you don’t only have physical hunger, you have emotional hunger. A lot of my hungers are, in fact, emotional. I think a lot of fat people’s hungers are emotional. There are things we very much want, and it can be so difficult to satisfy those hungers. Yet we try. We try so hard.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>You write, “Fat, much like skin color, is something you cannot hide, no matter how dark the clothing you wear, or how diligently you avoid horizontal stripes.” Later, you talk about how people are afraid to become fat because they know how fat people are treated and how they perceive fat people themselves. It made me think about the ways people’s privilege can shift when it comes to things like disability or fatness, allowing them to enter places and leave others, depending on their circumstances—and on what’s visible. I’m wondering how you think about the way that fatness and race, for example, are tied together in this way: they’re both visible, but you can theoretically transition in and out of fatness, while race is more fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Roxane Gay: </strong>That’s the thing about oppressions. Some of them are permanent and some of them are not. And yet, many of them are highly visible: gender, race and ethnicity, body size, disability. The visibly queer body is always treated as spectacle. For fat bodies, it can be quite a challenge to deal with both the systemic issues and the cultural issues, and to have people projecting narratives onto your body from the moment you leave your house until the moment you return. People see you, and all of a sudden they’re medical experts.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>Trauma is the source of the reality of part of your body, and you write about it vividly. A lot of the experience of reading this book was like being physically shaken.</p>
<p><strong>Roxane Gay: </strong>When you live in the world in a fat body, you are always wary of violence. Mostly emotional violence, but sometimes physical violence, because people just have such utter disregard for our bodies. That has certainly shaped most of my interactions with other human beings. At this point in my life, I wouldn’t know someone was threatening me unless they were holding a fucking hammer, because I am just so accustomed to thinking no one is going to approach my body with kindness. I see other human beings as threats before I can ever see them as potential lovers.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>Toward the end, you write about looking up your rapist online and the things you learned about him. There was something really intense and unexpected about how you took the exposure and violence you experienced and turned it back on him. How did it feel to look this guy up, and also wield this experience as an essay?</p>
<p><strong>Roxane Gay: </strong>What it provided was not closure, but knowledge. Like, where is he? What is he doing? I didn’t learn everything I wanted to learn, but I learned enough. In many ways it felt like a little bit of an obsession. Having that obsession was satisfying, to a certain extent.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>You write, “The more successful I get, the more I am reminded that in the minds of a great many people I will never be anything more than my body. No matter what I accomplish, I will be fat, first and foremost.” I think a lot about the concept and language around brilliance and genius, and how it relates to the body—how fat people, especially fat women, especially fat women of color, are robbed of these labels because people think about fatness as equal to bumbling and stupid, and we don’t have the ability to separate those things. There was this horrible quote in the recent Shirley Jackson biography where a friend of hers said something to the effect of, “Oh yes, Shirley was so fat, <em>but</em> she was brilliant.” She couldn’t reconcile those things.</p>
<p><strong>Roxane Gay: </strong>It&#8217;s a very weird cultural perception that if you’re fat you’re dumb, that you’re lazy or a loser. Clearly, those are the preconditions for fatness. You’re a failure, because only a lazy person, only a dumb person, would allow themselves to get into this situation. It’s appalling that this is the mindset. People generally treat fat people like we don’t know anything about anything. It’s incredibly demeaning. And incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>I was really interested in your discussion of language and euphemism, what you call the “taxonomy” of fatness: the labels we use to talk about the fat body, how they’re used by people who are hostile, how if they’re uncomfortable they’ll use a word like “voluptuous” because they’re trying to sugarcoat their language. You also describe the word “obese” as an accusation. How does language figure into our discussion and framing of the fat body?</p>
<p><strong>Roxane Gay: </strong>Generally, the ways we discuss the fat body pathologize it; we treat it as a medical problem and/or a social problem that must be solved. “Morbid obesity” is in many ways saying we are the walking dead. Or walking to our death. And that is no way to live, with that sort of moniker hanging over your head at all times. I think it forces fat people to internalize a lot of unnecessary self-loathing.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>You write about Oprah, who literally appears on the cover of her own magazine every month, but is constantly performing this self-flagellation about her weight. What do you make of public figures who grapple with this idea about their own bodies?</p>
<p><strong>Roxane Gay: </strong>It shows how pervasive fatphobia is, that even when a woman like Oprah—who’s a billionaire, and is sixty years old—achieves incredible success she’s still like, “There’s a skinny woman inside of me, dying to get out.” First of all, you’re not fat. Second of all: <em>What? </em>It breaks my heart, and it makes me feel kind of hopeless, and it makes me wonder if I will ever get to a place of peace with my own body. If Oprah can’t come to peace with her body, what chance do the rest of us have?</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>I want to talk about the “Tell Me I’m Fat” episode of <em>This American Life</em>. I loved the fact that you talked about fatness, and its intersection with race, and the nuances of privilege within fatness. But your interview was relatively short within the episode, which overall I thought was framed weirdly—like how Ira Glass said, “Grab a Twinkie,” at the transition. What was your experience of having this conversation about fatness in a very public way?</p>
<p><strong>Roxane Gay: </strong>That was actually one of the more frustrating interviews I’ve ever done. I mean, I’m sure Ira Glass is a nice person and all, and I know he’s well-respected, and that’s wonderful. But he clearly had no clue how to talk to a fat black woman about fatness, and his questions were just offensive. I felt aggravated and defensive, as if I was explaining “Different Bodies 101” to someone who’s never ever worried about his weight, and who’s just never considered what it’s like to be in a different kind of body.</p>
<p>I was actually surprised that the cut of the interview turned out the way it did, because the interview was such a disaster. Then I heard the show and the Twinkie comment, and I just thought, “He talked to three women about fat and learned nothing.” That Twinkie comment was so unnecessary and so cruel. Why would you say that? It just shows that even so-called evolved, liberal people are not that evolved about some things. That this person who is supposed to get it didn’t learn a damn thing—it just shows how much work there is to be done in terms of talking about fat positivity and fat acceptance.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>You talk in <em>Hunger</em> about your struggle with accepting your body and also your struggle with the so-called “fat-positive movement.” I think it’s obvious why the fat-positive movement is important—in one interview you called it a “necessary corrective.” What sort of changes would you want to see in it, as a movement?</p>
<p><strong>Roxane Gay: </strong>I don’t know if I want to see any changes; I think it’s a wonderful movement. What I want to see are additions. I want it to be more inclusive. The other day I saw something on Twitter that referred to people as “small fat” and “large fat,” and I would love to see people be more inclusive of the concerns of larger fat people.</p>
<p>This is a memoir, not a polemic, and I’m not a spokesperson for the fat community by any stretch, nor would they want me to be. But I would love to see more acknowledgement of how challenging it is to feel positive about fatness when you can’t find clothing. When there literally is not something made for your body. Nobody ever talks about that; all those fat girl clothes swaps and stuff are for a very specific kind of fat girl.</p>
<p>If I was Lane Bryant fat, I would be joyful about fatness. I’m fat positive, in that I don’t see fat as a bad thing. But what I do see as a bad thing is how I’m treated. I can have the most positive outlook in the world, but that is not going to change how hecklers and people walking down the street are yelling at me.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>Do you have any hope that the conversation about fat bodies will change or evolve?</p>
<p><strong>Roxane Gay: </strong>I have to, of course. Of course. I don’t have a <em>lot </em>of hope, because I think this is one of those final frontiers of open discrimination, but, yes, I absolutely do have hope that we are going to include body diversity as we are thinking about diversity, and get better about fatness. And I very much hope we do, because so many people have fat bodies and deserve to live full lives, and deserve to be emotionally healthy. Part of that will come from societal acceptance.</p>

From the collection of the <a href='www.awm.gov.au/collection/017633/'>Australian War Memorial</a>.]</i> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2007, as the fall semester loomed, I had a massive depressive episode and was forced to take a semester off from Cornell. Earlier that year, I’d spent a few months in Beijing learning Chinese. While I was studying abroad I also learned that the lake at Tsinghua University was a great spot for cruising after dark. I learned this because I was a nineteen-year-old gay virgin determined to change before my third decade began. I hopped on the Great Firewall-approved search engine and searched for “where to fuck in Beijing.” I was trying, however awkwardly, to do the things I saw well-adjusted adults doing. Thankfully, the unerringly accurate Internet was right-on in identifying a leafy stretch of lakeshore property as a prime locale for no-strings-attached boning down in the heart of BJ’s University District. Among the regulars were the fey, bossy Sichuanese queers who demanded that you wear two condoms (even if you told them that such a practice was actually<i> more</i> dangerous) and expelled you the moment they came—complete with cutesy, feminine yelps of pleasure. There were stocky young men, students maybe, who came from China’s northeastern heartland, with ruddy faces and thick lips. There was the guy I’ll call Wuming. He was a little older than the rest, but he more than made up for it in enthusiasm. Not a looker, but it was hard to see much of anything in the scurrying darkness anyway. On nights I spent prowling the Tsinghua campus, Wuming would approach me and ask, in a soft voice, <i>Ni gan le ma? </i>Have you fucked yet? He wanted me. He enjoyed what I could provide him. The feeling of a mutual, special connection was ineffable and transformative. Like alcohol and hashish, whose gentle hands helped massage and deescalate my naturally hyperactive and worried mind, sex was a way to feel good about myself without having to face all the reasons I felt bad about myself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back home in Washington State, I continued to use the Internet to find strangers for furtive fucking with the enthusiasm of a juvenile jackhammer. That summer I was either reading about the Cold War (John Lewis Gaddis is excellent escapism for political science majors), working for a family friend’s catering business, or fucking anyone who would have me. The escape of the thing, the essential joy, wasn’t really in the beauty of my partners (at the time I could imagine no scenario where a remotely attractive person would feel attracted to lumpy, short, misanthropic me). It wasn’t until I flew down to San Francisco that summer to visit a friend from my Chinese program that the emotional and intellectual consequences of the physical act of love became real. We went to a bar with my friend Charley’s best friend, Owen. We got drunk, and the foolproof confidence boost of ethanol led me to hit on Owen in a shameless way that is the hallmark of the melancholy inebriate. With a few bumps of the knee, Owen and I began a weeklong affair of fucking and drinking. One time we were balling in the Murphy bed on the ground floor of Charley’s family’s beach house on Half Moon Bay, and Owen asked if he could call me “Daddy.” I had an immediate and sharp response: Absolutely not. Creepy, I felt. So he called me “Baby,” which was somehow less gross.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am apprehensive about ever holding the office of “dad,” and shy about reenacting the experience of relating to my father, role-playing <i>being</i> my father, engaging in sexual acts that would disgust him. At the same time, I can’t help but think there’s something deeper at work. What’s wrong with me that I only call my dad “Jeff,” and not “Dad”? And why am I so resistant to the idea of some harmless sex role-play? There is something about the parentification inherent in that moniker that I fear will transform me into a caretaker. When I was a child, and I lived with my single mom, she relied on me—a lot. I made many choices that were not mine to make. I don’t want to inhabit the ill-fitting loafers and polo shirts of a dad; I don’t want to assume the mantle of Daddy who will make everything alright. To be with some twink, with continents of bacne, screaming “Daddy! Daddy!” puts me most in mind of coming to the aid of a child.</span></p>
<div class="asterisks">* * *</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When they are not being bitterly condemned by dispiritingly vast numbers of ignorant, hateful, useless Americans, gay sex and culture have traditionally been reified or used as comedic tropes. Talking about things like my reluctance to engage in power-based role play brings us into the territory of prurient anthropology that so often muddies serious discussion of intimacy among gay people. I am not ashamed to be gay, and I am, to be sure, not a Neil-Patrick-Harris, assimilationist, domesticated homosexual. On the contrary, I am proud of the multiplicity of bizarre ways my people choose to express themselves and their love. Still, when a character with the ability to summon ghosts of the past such as Daddy is thrust upon me, it slices open deep veins of memory, and unintegrated, raw, and long-repressed feelings come pouring out. How do I tell someone, as I struggle to open the condom wrapper with my teeth, that my relationship to my father as a child was layered at best, and completely dysfunctional at status quo? This confrontation with the vast ocean of my past that lingers, haunting me with its unfinished business, now seems inevitable. But “integrating” these memories<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>a psychotherapeutic term of art, which eloquently describes the negative consequences of raw emotions without providing a uniform prescription for ameliorating them<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>does not come naturally. While I now know that I can never escape the past, confidently and productively engaging with it will require a long commitment to seeking insight at any price.</span></p>
<div class="asterisks">* * *</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Maybe I should embrace the camp aspect of the “son” asking for more and harder fucking from his “daddy.” Maybe if I focus on my own pleasure, and on my partner’s pleasure, instead of endlessly ruminating on the semiotics of what gets him off, then I can put Daddy in a box where he means no more to me than any other mild kink. Instead of choosing to make “Daddy” forever and always associated with the weighty responsibilities of childrearing, perhaps I can selectively snip out its kinky <i>puissance</i> to fuel my fleeting, breathless encounters. This kind of mutual fantasizing and world-building not only helps keep the bottoms happy, it provides a stage on which the two of us can play out our interpersonal fears and expose our most vulnerable parts. With the right partner, fantasy and sexual deviance can be a form of productive psychotherapy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Thinking of all the ways in which men I dated have put me off, or the tiny signifiers that disqualified them from ever again being graced with my presence, I see that I’ve put up many walls disguised as evidently incoherent moral strictures. Subtle differences of class, a doctrinaire demand that Judith Butler is a fluid writer—many things about a person that others would consider part and parcel for an honest relationship with a fellow human—have broken many promising romantic deals.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sex can be an experience of temporal transcendence and personal fulfillment unsurpassed by anything else in this human slog. When I come at this aspect of a relationship with predetermined ideas about what is, and is not, healthy discourse in a pairing, then I have already sabotaged the possibility of true intimacy. Reckoning with this has sparked within me a desire to put my greatest effort in a relationship toward ignoring the trivial—and emphasizing skills like empathy, nurturance, and equanimity in the face of stress.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">From this writing forward, the men who are saintly enough to have sex with me can call me by whatever name they like—Daddy, Your Highness, Maurice—and I’ll respond in kind. Experimentation refers not just to sexual positions, but to acting out diverse styles of emotional connection. As great sex can be transcendent, so too can love allow you to transcend the fortifications and great monuments of your preconceptions. But another person can only help you if you allow them to pick apart old dogmas, and to defoliate vast, dying forests of defensive stumps.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Speaking again of penetration and its impediments, I am reminded of the farcical scenario where my partner and I race against my deflating erection to have a worthwhile emotional connection. Some things are just inevitably awkward: on a given first date, or first encounter, I can think of little else but psychoanalyzing my prospective mate. I want to know the <i>origin</i> of their sexual deviance. What does it mean to them when they howl, “Oh, Daddy, don’t stop!”? Not caring to explore what makes a person’s boner tickle in terms of their childhood development is, in my opinion, sexual malpractice, and represents an inexcusable dearth of curiosity. “How is your relationship to your own father?” I want to ask the nubile twentysomething I’ve cajoled into my bed. I ask questions from the classical Freudian interview when I’ve somehow managed to lose interest in a blowjob, to have the thread of sexual release slip away from me and be replaced with unwanted thoughts of the most pitifully mundane quality. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“I see,” I reply to his explanation of his father’s distant but constant parenting style. [<em>Sound of talking with cock in mouth, cf. patient trying to talk with dentist drill in mouth.</em>] “Ah, so he was hardly ever at home? Hmm. So you never really knew him? It seems like calling <i>me</i> Daddy might be a way to call for a daddy who will actually be there when you need him.” And as night follows day, I notice that I’ve turned softer than Eric Trump’s chin. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To be a mere <i>spectator</i> to a partner’s sexual stimuli is grossly insufficient. One must be willing to participate and actively understand just what makes him so damn horny when he says the word “Daddy.” You must be willing to go on a journey of discovery with your partner. If my <i>own</i> pain and intense equivocation about “Daddy” are worthy of examination, then why not allow my partner the same courtesy?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Love, vulnerability, sodomy—these are the three pillars of happy gay life. Live a relationship not for yourself, or for the purpose of purely supporting another, but as an experience that can lead to growth and insight for both of you. </span><span class="s2">When you are prepared to consensually give of yourself, and take from your partner, try to succumb to the river of &#8220;Yes,&#8221; at least at first. Follow your yearnings. </span><span class="s1">The worst that can unfold is you have to stop the music and admit you really don’t want to be fisted today, or ever. You have to engage your fears to find out just what you’re afraid of, and how much of it you can bear. The truth is the most powerful force for liberating minds and cocks—we must wield it bravely, and demand nothing less from others.</span></p>

Entitled <em>The Grater Divide</em> (2002), the work, by Lebanese-born Palestinian-British artist Mona Hatoum, speaks to the current climate and context of Israeli contemporary art, where the Ministry of Culture has frequently clashed with left-leaning arts groups and where the effects of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which tries to block Israeli artists and Israeli funded groups from exhibiting globally, on the Israeli art world are being debated everywhere. Palestinian and Israeli artists alike are wrestling with issues of identity and home.</p>
<p>Whether the venue is the Israel Museum, an international institution that receives less than 15 percent of its annual income from the state; the Petach Tikva Museum, funded by the municipality; the Ein Harod Museum, funded by kibbutzim; the Umm El Fahem Gallery of Palestinian Art, funded by the Israeli government; nonprofit arts collectives, who piece together modest funding from diverse private and public sources; or commercial galleries who are in active pursuit of global collectors, funding is precarious, and political and economic issues are often inextricably intertwined with aesthetic concerns.</p>
<p>Leading a spring tour of exhibits at the Israel Museum for <a href="http://artiscontemporary.org/">Artis,</a> a nonprofit that brings curators from throughout the world to Israel for contemporary art research trips, Mira Lapidot, the Yulia and Jacques Lipchitz chief curator of the arts, raises the big question: “Is there a moral commitment for art to be engaged with what’s happening in the world?” A one-week trip delving into the contemporary art scene, designed for Artis by Chen Tamir, curator, CCA Tel Aviv and associate curator Artis provides a resounding answer: yes.</p>
<p>A concern for what’s happening in the world, and more specifically in Israel, is at the heart of socially engaged photographer <a href="https://www.ron-amir.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron Amir’s</a> show, <em>Doing Time in Holot </em>at the Israel Museum, an exhibit that focuses on asylum-seekers from Eritrea (mostly Christians) and Sudan (mostly Muslims) who are currently being detained in open prisons (detention centers) in the southern Negev. Often there for up to one year, detainees have absolutely nothing to do. “The idea is to discourage them from staying in Israel,” said Amir, who befriended the detained asylum-seekers by sharing food with them, eventually establishing personal relationships. He focused on their life outside the center buildings rather than inside, “to make people be the center,” convinced that these images would be more surprising than the detention center itself. In a long video shot by Amir that accompanies the photo exhibit, there is no narrative. “It’s about free time in Holot,” said the exhibit’s curator Noam Gal. “People sit there, and nothing happens. They drink coffee and they smoke cigarettes.”</p>
<p>Renowned photojournalist and activist Miki Kratsman has a direct view of the asylum seekers from his storefront in the Florentine neighborhood of Tel Aviv. Kratsman, who lives upstairs, describes the space as a “store that doesn’t sell anything.” The area is full of asylum seekers; hundreds live across the street from him in a building whose façade is covered by a maze of intertwined electric lines. “They come here and I photograph them. I do not ask their names. I do not publish anything. My only publication is on the wall. When they leave, I give them a print of the image for free.”</p>
<p>Kratsman, who came to Israel from Argentina when he was twelve, boasts that by the age of sixteen he was already attending demonstrations. Since that time, he has served in the army, worked for thirty years as a photojournalist for Hadashot and HaAretz, mainly in the occupied territories, and, until two years ago, served as the head of the photography department at Israel’s leading art school<strong>, </strong>the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design. Kratsman co-founded <a href="http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/about/organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breaking the Silence</a>, an organization of veteran combatants who have chosen to speak out publicly about the realities of everyday life in the Occupied Territories. “They call us traitors,” Kratsman said.</p>
<p>Kratsman, whose controversial show of three thousand portraits of Palestinians at Tel Aviv Museum (a joint exhibit with the Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei) was canceled because of political pressure, gave me a sneak preview of a video that he is now editing from 2015 to 2016 when he attended a demonstration in the Palestinian village of Nabi Salih. “Many people were seriously injured there,” he said, explaining that he shot video without any specific idea what he was going to do with the footage. Subsequently, he has decided to edit the video according to the sounds of the shooting. As his video camera captures the confrontation, we hear the sounds of bullets, teargas, and grenades.</p>
<p>Kratsman now has sixty thousand followers on his Facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kratsman.people.i.met/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miki Kratsman: People I Met</a>, and almost sixteen thousand likes, most of them from Palestinians, on the site where he uploaded the faces of eight thousand Palestinians, many of the photos taken at a huge parade in 2007. Kratsman asked viewers to put a circle around the people who were martyred and to send him information of the whereabouts of the others. “Only two people wanted their photos removed,” he said. “For this project, somehow, the comments became the output.” He cited two comments: “See him in the streets. He is still alive,” said one follower; “That child is now twenty-three and he was killed today in Jenin,” wrote another.</p>
<p>But despite his passionate activism, Kratsman feels deep loyalty to Israel. “I would prefer to boycott only the settlements,” he said, “and not boycott all of the country. I cannot boycott myself. I wake up every morning. The problem is that I am an optimist. I can’t live in any other place.”</p>

<p>Although she didn’t exactly says so, <a href="http://raidaadon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raida Adon</a>, a self-defined Palestinian and Israeli artist and film and video actress, would probably not live in any other place, either. “We have Jews, Muslims, and Christians in the family,” she said. “I can’t choose one thing. But, I can’t say that I am completely Israeli either.” Adon’s studio is based in her Jaffa apartment, where a suitcase that she made, just big enough for her to perform in, occupies one corner of the salon. The piece, <em>Strangeness</em>, follows from an earlier video, <em><a href="http://raidaadon.com/portfolio_page/woman-without-a-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Woman without a Home</a></em>, where she is seen on camera dragging her bed across a snowy landscape near Mt. Hermon. “I was trying to find my homeland when I was doing this,” Adon said. “But no one knew that I was really sick. That it was personal.” Before shooting all of her videos, Adon paints a storyboard, sews all of the costumes, and makes the entire set.</p>
<p>Adon doesn’t yet have a gallery and wishes that she had one. “Maybe it’s because I’m both Palestinian and Israeli,” she said, “or maybe it’s because video art just doesn’t bring in money.” For the present, her studio is in the street. “We need to respect each other,” she said. “If you see people, you listen to people.”</p>
<p>There is no doubt that video artist Dor Guez knows how to listen and to do research. Drawing upon his cultural heritage, Palestinian-Christian on his mother’s side and Jewish Tunisian on his father’s, Guez focuses on the <em>other</em> in his video work. His ongoing project, <em>The Sick Man of Europe</em>, deals with the legacy (both historical and cultural) of the former Ottoman Empire. On view at The Museum for Islamic Art in Jerusalem in April was the third part in this series, <em>The Composer</em>, the story of an Armenian composer whose family was deported from their hometown during the Armenian genocide. Two earlier video projects, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HjpCXfBHDg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watermelons Under the Bed</a></em> (2010) and <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGbLd4WJw-o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Sa) Mira</a></em> (2009) illuminate the Arab-Christian and Arab experiences. In <em>(Sa) Mira</em>, a Palestinian Hebrew University student speaks about being asked to change her name on the dinner receipt by her Israeli restaurant employer. The powerful video moves from what seems to be a lightly told anecdotal tale to one that reduces the speaker to tears. Why should she change her name from her birth name Samira to conceal her Palestinian identity? Why should she sign her checks with the Israeli name Mira? Two letters, <em>Sa</em>, speak to the pain of her <em>greater divide.</em></p>
<p>More contemporary art, often with a political edge, can also be found beyond the stone walls in Jerusalem and the white stucco Bauhaus residences of Tel Aviv: in Petach Tikva, or Herzliya, or Ein Harod, and even in the Palestinian village of Umm El Fahem.</p>
<p><em>Citizens,</em> an exhibit at the Petach Tikva Museum of Art, curated by Neta Gal-Azmon, explores the tension between states and citizens, and raises questions about freedom and the lack thereof. Prominent in the exhibit is <a href="https://www.zachacmon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zac Hacmon’s</a> <em>T.A.Z. </em>(<em>Temporary Autonomous Zone</em>) (2014), a recreation of a guard booth, slightly smaller than life-size to heighten the feeling of claustrophobia, that draws upon the artist’s own experience working as a security guard, a job many young Israelis took after finishing their military service. The booth is understood as both a refuge and a place of authority. Hacmon has installed a CCTV that screens all activities in the museum through the lenses of four security cameras and spectators are invited inside to become security guards themselves. “The booth, “Hacmon said, “is not something we study in architecture school. It is invisible.”</p>
<p>At the Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art, <em>In Her Footsteps</em>, an exhibit of eight women artists, includes Michal Heiman’s <em>AP—Artist Proof, Asylum </em>(<em>The Dress, 1955<span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span>2017</em>). With its artistic lens turned inward, this introspective work includes installation, performance, video, sound, photographs, floor work, objects, documents, and archival display. While doing research in the book <em>The Face of Madness: Hugh W. Diamond and the Origin of Psychiatric Photography</em>, Heiman found her adolescent self in an image of a woman (Plate 34) who lived in a British asylum. She began taking multiple portraits of women, including herself, wearing a plaid dress that replicated the uniform of the residents in the institution. “I saw myself in the book, and I asked, &#8216;What does it mean to <em>return</em> to oneself?&#8217; At the same time, I asked, &#8216;What does the <em>right of return</em> mean in Israel?&#8217;” Heiman believes that we have much to learn from this history. “Strategies of how to survive in the nineteenth century have many parallels with strategies of asylum seekers today.”</p>
<p>Over sixty thousand Palestinians live in the town of Umm El Fahem, located in Israel on the seam at the border of the West Bank. The town is home to the <a href="https://www.ummelfahemgallery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umm El-Fahem gallery</a>, a nonprofit space that director Said Abu Shakra hopes to turn into the first Palestinian Museum inside Israel. Shakra proudly shows off a model for the new museum, for which the Finance Office of the Israeli Government has secured about five million dollars, contingent on his raising matching funds. “No easy task,” Shakra said, “since his Arab brothers say, ‘You took money from the Israeli government; they will control you.’” Although the gallery is presently “a museum in a very small house,” he hopes that its twelve-year-long gestation period will soon be at an end. “Perhaps this year or next,” he said. Yael Reinharz, Artis executive director, added, “It is important that visitors to Israel meet Said to learn about his bold vision as well as the challenges of being an Arab-Palestinian gallery that is supported by the Israeli government and within the confines of the 1967 borders.”</p>
<p>Shakra believes that his gallery can help Jews “touch the Palestinian narrative, and create empathy and respect.” On view in April was the work of his brother, artist Farid Abu Shakra, and <em>The Sea of Fire, </em>an exhibit by Arab-Israeli photographer Ammar Younis. The show does not include pictures of either Intifada but rather several color images from <em>Waste Bank</em> (2013), documenting a garbage dump near the Palestinian village of Yata, and striking photos from <em>Brides in White</em>, a series focusing on the elderly women of Wadi Ara.</p>
<p>A half hour’s drive from Umm el Fahem is the <a href="http://museumeinharod.org.il/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ein Harod Museum of Art</a>, a Bauhaus-inspired building by architect Shmuel Bickels that infuses natural light throughout the galleries. Built in 1948 and holding the distinction of being the first museum in the country, it grew out of the collective’s ideology that their kibbutz would become a cultural center. Along with the museum, they established a theater, a book publishing enterprise, and a music center. Director Yaniv Shapira spoke of the museum’s extensive collection of Judaica, Jewish art, Israeli art, and kibbutz art. “For many years,” he said, “we tried to be an alternative to the main venues in the big museums.” Today Shapira describes the place as an art, cultural, educational, and social center for Arabs and Israelis. Owned by three kibbutzim, the museum struggles to fulfill its mission on modest finances. On view was <em>Back to Life</em>, an exhibit dedicated to the New Barbizon Group, five female Russian émigré artists who paint from observation. Shapira said that the show is “one of the most popular exhibits in Israel.” At the end of May, the entire museum was turned over to the Euphoria Project on the fiftieth anniversary of the Six-Day War (1967). “The war began the occupation and there will be five different exhibits dealing with this open wound,” Shapira said. “We will touch heavy issues.”</p>
<p>Chen Tamir sighs when she speaks of the current culture wars. Israeli arts institutions are now required to comply with regulations pushed by the right wing and imposed by the Ministry of Culture, headed by the controversial Miri Regev. If they do not exhibit their work or perform in the territories/settlements, their budget is cut 30 percent. If they do, their budget is only cut 2 percent. “Anyone advocating for boycott can now be penalized,” Tamir says, adding that “government funding that is in place is terribly managed.” The <a href="http://www.almamalfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Al Ma’Mal Foundation</a>, a nonprofit established “to promote, instigate, disseminate and create art” has solved their funding problems another way. Housed in a former tile factory in the Old City, the Foundation receives core funding from the Swedish Development Agency. “We’re in a cloud in Jerusalem,” director Aline Khoury said. “We don’t take funding from the Israeli government. We don’t agree with their politics.”</p>
<p>Established Israeli artist <a href="https://www.sigalitlandau.com/" target="new">Sigalit Landau</a> holds strong opinions on the current climate in the Israeli contemporary art world. For more than two decades, Landau’s work, in video, sculpture, and performance, poked and prodded at existing norms, sprinkling salt on the psychological, ecological, and often still-open physical wounds of Israeli life. In <em><a href="https://www.sigalitlandau.com/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barbed Hula</a></em> (2000), the camera focused on her nude body, a Hula-Hoop made of barbed wire around her waist. With every move, intense pain. Five years later, in <em><a href="https://www.sigalitlandau.com/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeadSee</a></em>, Landau filmed herself floating in the Dead Sea, surrounded by hundreds of watermelons (some open to reveal wound-like red flesh) that were joined by a rope to form a spiral. Pulling the rope unraveled the spiral.</p>
<p>Landau describes her art work as “bridge-building”: “In my [sub]conscious I search for new and vital materials for connecting the past with the future, the East with the West, and the private with the collective,” she said. And that is exactly what she has been doing over the past two years in her latest project, which involves designing a bridge that will float on the Dead Sea. At one time, she envisioned building a salt-encrusted bridge linking Israel and Jordan that would simultaneously call attention to the lowering of the sea’s waterline and to Israel and Jordan’s peaceful relations. With approvals hard to come by from Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority, her latest design calls for a bridge, fifty meters long, twenty-eight meters across, and four meters high, floating in the middle of the lake and accessible to swimmers and boaters.</p>
<p>Landau likes the fact that she is not dealing with a museum or a curator. She believes that museum boards and committees have grown in strength and that “people with charisma are not tolerated as much as they used to be in Israeli Institutions.” Always outspoken, Landau labels the boycott as “boring. You just don’t get invited,” she said. She’s not worried, though. Over the past two months, she has been working on five installations and a major book on her projects will be coming out in August.</p>
<p>Younger Israeli artists face the tensions in the contemporary art climate with hope and determination. <a href="http://www.artportlv.org/artist/fatma-shanan-dery/2016-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fatma Shanan Dery</a>, a Druze painter, with a studio at the soon-to-be-torn-down Artport Collective, speaks of her upcoming exhibit at the Tel Aviv Museum in June. With paintings that resemble oriental rugs, she struggles to develop and grow in a traditional community. While most Druze live in Syria, some one hundred twenty thousand live in Israel. “For me, the issue always is, how do I create my <em>own</em> space? “ Roni Hajaj, an Israeli of Moroccan heritage, describes her style as completely spontaneous. “I often add found objects to the art works at the last minute, even on the day of the opening,” she said. Three woven mats with slabs of clay as pillows lie on the floor of her solo exhibit, <em><a href="http://rawart-gallery.com/content/roni-hajaj-foot-tops" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Foot, Tops</a></em>, in the RAW ART Gallery.</p>
<p>In the outdoor café of The Diaghilev, a live art boutique hotel in Tel Aviv, <a href="http://museum.imj.org.il/artcenter/newsite/en/?artist=Ullman,%20Micha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Micha Ullman</a> orders tea. At seventy-eight years of age, Ullman is considered by many to be one of Israel’s most prominent artists. He is currently at work on a piece for a new library in Jerusalem. All he will tell me is that it will be about &#8220;words.&#8221; Millions of people visit his memorial to the book burning in Berlin; an underground space with empty bookshelves viewed through glass from above.</p>
<p>Ullman says that he is an optimist but admits that the right wing worries him. In the last five years, aggression has changed both outside and inside the country. He sees the occupation as much more dangerous for the existence of Israel than the enemies that surround the country.</p>
<p>As a teenager, Ullman wanted to be a farmer, so it was no surprise that earth and digging entered his art. As a sculptor, more and more he became interested in the empty space that resulted from the digging—in the pit. “We sit seventy centimeters apart,” Ullman tells me. “Two pits. I am pushing air. You are pushing air. Speaking is the most beautiful music I know. In this music lies the solution.”</p>
<p>Another sip of tea, and Ullman adds a final thought, “I speak to my Arab friends. It opens the doors. You are not worth more or less than the person you are speaking to.”</p>

Courtesy of the Parker family collection, Monrovia, Liberia.]</i> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone who knew Nina Simone well—a Liberian friend of hers, I suppose a mutual friend now—told me a story. Liberia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s past is in pieces, he said, and here</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s one of them. Maybe it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s the one you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">re looking for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a September night in 1974, the wet season was closing down and an encore of rain washed the streets of Monrovia, Liberia; a torrent of sky and trash—discarded slippers, supine roaches, maybe a lost crab. The rain stopped as abruptly as it started, as if a conductor had pressed his fingers together and cut the thundering chords, and then a film of humidity stretched over the city, steaming the downtown party strip that ran from Carey Street to Broad and Gurley. That night, The Maze—a small discotheque on Mechlin Street—was cramped. Some fifty people, a cut of high society, had gathered despite the weather; women in draped dresses, men in suits with pocket squares and bow ties. Nina Simone arrived at midnight, giddy on champagne and in the arms of a Liberian date. By then the umbrellas in the corner had long dried and a mirror ball was sending out spots of light, bleaching the red velour curtains over and over. The speakers rang with imported soul and disco: James Brown, The Temptations, twelve-inch records from labels like Motown</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s Gordy and Stax. Living</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the City. Don</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t You Worry </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bout a Thing. Not long after Simone walked in, something got to her—the place or the drink, surely—and throwing her head back in laughter, she unfastened the button at her nape, peeled off her dress, and, as the men at the bar clapped and hollered, she danced until sun up, only putting her dress back on to leave.</span></p>
<p>I found another piece, a videotape.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Montreux jazz festival, in 1990, Nina Simone sat at a white baby grand. Her hair was cornrowed into a bun, her cheeks brushed red; double drop earrings grazed her neckline. Leaning into the mic, she introduced the mostly white, transfixed crowd to a jaunty, go-go song: “Liberian Calypso.” “This is a song we learned from when we were in Liberia, for the three years we lived there; I guess most of you know about that,” she said. “In the middle of it I want you to sing with me: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run, Nina.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the audience warmed up to the chorus, Simone slammed on the spruce, singing the story of that night at The Maze.</span></p>
<p>I pressed the pieces together—two at first, then more, linking shards of story with pins and rivets as though imperfectly mending a ceramic pot.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I listened to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberian Calypso</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">again and again. A 1982 release from Simone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s penultimate album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fodder on My Wings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it isn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t her most striking composition, yet there is something remarkable about it: the story of an erotic dance, told through small and sweet lyrics (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My joy it was so complete, you know. My friend was happy, he said, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go! Go!’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). With its colorful chords and childlike verse (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I danced for hours, hours on end. I said, ‘Dear Lord, you are my friend’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">), almost all sensuality has been scraped away, exposing the muscle below (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You brought me home to Liberia, and all other places are inferior</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). That night at The Maze, Nina Simone stripped right down to her bones. And the song she wrote about it is—rare for Simone—a love song without longing, a ballad to a land that set her free.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1974, when Simone moved to Monrovia, it was among the most decadent places to party in Africa. More than a century after the American Colonization Society planted the Liberian flag, in 1847, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberia was enjoying one last dance before the civil-war years to come; politicians and the educated elite had more dollar power than ever before. President William R. Tolbert Jr., a Baptist preacher and descendent of the original settlers, had been in power for three years, having succeeded William V.S. Tubman upon his death in 1971. Tolbert was more liberal and progressive than his predecessor, announcing a social-reform agenda—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Involvement for Higher Heights,” designed to narrow the gap between native Liberians and the educated elite—and encouraging freedom of expression. His movement met the black-consciousness movement on its journey northwest from South Africa, merging too with the post-independence projects of Liberia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s neighbors: Cote d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Senegal. As the spotlight swung from the old guard of conservative status-quoists to a new wave of progressive politicians, Liberia drew students, activists, political leaders, and musicians from Africa and black America—among them James Brown, Stokely Carmichael, Miriam Makeba, Nelson Mandela, Hugh Masekela, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a time when Liberia was discovering itself,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Dr. Elwood Dunn, a Liberian historian and Tolbert</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s former minister of state for presidential affairs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until that time, we had been living in splendid isolation. Suddenly, all these international students from other African countries were here. They were speaking the language of liberation, of freedom.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a language that Simone spoke fluently. She was forty-one when she first landed at Robertsfield International Airport, her twelve-year-old daughter Lisa in tow, their belongings—clothes, books, records—packed into the belly of a Pan Am jet. Six years had passed since Martin Luther King Jr.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s assassination; nine since Simone had belted out protest songs during the Selma to Montgomery voting-rights march. Although black America still saw her as a talented political performer, a civil-rights revolutionary armed with loud and furious song—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, but this whole country is full of lies, you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">re all gonna die and die like flies,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">she sang in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mississippi Goddam,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">berating the go-slow politics of the Johnson administration—she had seen little racial progress. Two of the big six were dead, as were her friends Langston Hughes and Malcom X; Huey Newton and Bobby Seale were in jail. The rhythm of the civil-rights movement had ebbed, and Simone wondered if her cris de coeur for a more just racial order had fallen short.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The America I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">d dreamed of through the sixties seemed a bad joke now, with Nixon in the White House and the black revolution replaced by disco,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">she wrote in her memoir, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Put a Spell on You</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the America of the sixties was a joke, the America that Simone had imagined in the fifties seemed downright impossible; she was still angered by her rejection from the Curtis School of Music in 1951. Having previously been accepted by a summer program at Juilliard, she felt the decision was based on the color of her skin. With it she</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">d begun to let go of her dream of becoming America</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s first black concert pianist, shedding her birth name (Eunice Waymon) and moving to Atlantic City, where she became Nina Simone, played cocktail jazz (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the devil</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s music,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">her mother called it), and sang in public for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But no matter the rousing depths of her voice and repertoire—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four Women</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My skin is black, my arms are long, my hair is woolly, and my back is strong</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">); </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Be Young, Gifted and Black” (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your soul</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s intact</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">); a cover of Billy Taylor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Livingston Seagull ain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t got nothin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on me,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she once improvised);</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Shall Be Released” (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any day now, any day now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">)—she still felt that white America wasn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t listening. (She frequently admonished audiences for the same, glaring and employing long pauses to enforce Carnegie Hall rules at jazz festivals.) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s personal life wasn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t much brighter. Her turbulent marriage to the Harlem police detective Andy Stroud had ended, and she was grieving her father</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s death. After a stint living in Barbados, where she dated the Prime Minister Errol Barrow, she and Lisa were back in the US, living in a Manhattan apartment; mounting financial troubles forced the sale of their Mount Vernon home. So when Miriam Makeba called in August 1974 and invited them to Liberia, Simone agreed. Makeba was due to meet Stephen Tolbert, the president</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s brother, there. He was funding Zaire </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">74, the Kinshasa music festival that would accompany the Rumble in the Jungle boxing fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman that fall; Makeba was on the lineup, along with James Brown, B.B. King, and Bill Withers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa, half a world away from New York,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone wrote in her memoir. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe I could find some peace there, or a husband. Maybe it would be like going home.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home, which ran on the dollars and accents of America but not its black prejudice; home, where skin color was not an impediment but a ticket to the top tier of society (Liberia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s constitution has long barred whites from becoming citizens); home, where black musicians and activists like Stokely Carmichael, Makeba, and Masekela had found freedom. Within days of touchdown, Simone had met President Tolbert and the educated elite of Monrovia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s social scene—the Coopers, the Dennises</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Dunbars, the Parkers, and the Tubmans. In Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s first republic nobody would have dared cut them down because they were black (although they, as Simone would later understand, separated themselves from other Liberians). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am keenly aware that I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ve entered a world that I had dreamed of all my life, and that it is a perfect world,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone said in a radio interview recorded from Monrovia and included in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Happened, Miss Simone?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Liz Garbus</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oscar-nominated documentary. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[America became] a dream that I had and had worked myself out of because I toiled for so long in that place, in that prison. And now I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">m home, now I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">m free.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>

<p>James Dennis, our mutual acquaintance, met Simone soon after she arrived in Monrovia. A retired journalist, at eighty-seven he is one of her last surviving Liberian friends.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Nina came here, she fit in right away,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was a very affable lady: highly educated, an entertainer. Her daughter Lisa was just about the age of my only daughter, so they got along very nicely. And Nina loved Africa, she loved Liberia in particular. The country was glorious in those days. People from all over the continent came to Liberia to get a taste of America, just as they went to Cote d’Ivoire to see what France would be like.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wealthy Liberians and foreign dignitaries embraced the high life, eating carpaccio at Salvatore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s Italian restaurant, sipping cocktails in the swim-up bar at the iconic Ducor Palace Hotel, overnighting at Robertsfield Hotel in Marshall, where the kitchen was overseen by a Swiss chef. The Mesurado Group of Companies, founded by Tolbert</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s brother Stephen, shipped its shrimp to the best restaurants in Tokyo and New York. Clinical care was equally sophisticated; the John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital, which opened in 1971, was the finest in sub-Saharan Africa, with the most advanced operating theater on the continent and fountains dancing in its yard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At nightclubs like Hibiscus, DJs spun records from Liberian-born trailblazers like Soulful Dynamics and Afro Super 7, and chased them with Conga jazz, rhumba, and American soul. There were recording studios: first came ABC Studios at Waterside Market, where the Liberian artist Morris Dorley recorded his hit </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Are You Baby?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, later taking it to the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture in Lagos in 1977. Hugh Masekela co-founded Studio One, where singers like Christine Clinton, Miatta Fahnbulleh, Daisy Moore, and the Sherman Sisters recorded, and Yatta Zoe, a native Liberian musician, shot to the top of the charts with numbers like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You Took My Lappa [cloth skirt]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young Girls, Stop Drinking Lysol</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (after the disinfectant was marketed as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a cure for disappointment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; suicide rates among pregnant teenagers began to soar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a golden era in Monrovia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s history,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Eddie Dunn, who owned the club Hibiscus and often drank bourbon with Masekela. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were four flights to New York on Pan Am every week, so I had the latest records two days after they came out. People would say, &#8216;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did you get this so fast?&#8217;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p>James Dennis introduced Simone to his African American wife, Doris, who became a close confidant. And Simone took a hiatus from large public concerts and albums, choosing to perform mostly for friends—at private homes, birthday parties, or at clubs like The Maze. She also gave piano lessons. Among her piano students was Steve Tolbert, son of the finance minister and nephew of President Tolbert. Now in his fifties, he was about ten when he learned his first scales from Simone, cupping his fingers over hers so he could gauge the weight of the ebony sharps.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nina and I would share the piano stool at my father</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s house, and she</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">d blow smoke all over the keys,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tolbert said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She loved Bach, Beethoven, jazz, but she also taught me to play some of her songs. She swore like the devil</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” He added: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than anything I remember her eyes. There was so much power in them, something furious and wild. They had some kind of spell.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His younger brother, William A. Tolbert, was too small to remember Simone, but her voice burned into his brain. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the nineties, I was watching the movie</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Point of No Return</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and I heard Nina</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s voice on the soundtrack,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It sounded so familiar, almost maternal to me. I felt that it could have been my mom, or someone that close to me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He initially brushed it off, but a few years later he asked his mother if she</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">d heard of Nina Simone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked at me like I was crazy and said, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, of course I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ve heard of Nina Simone! You used to sit on her lap at our house.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, everything came together. I realized I had heard Nina</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s voice before; that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s why it was so familiar, so centering.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone rented a house on Congo Beach. There, she found what she had sought for decades: a sense of home, a feeling of belonging.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">She quickly decided that she would stay in Liberia “forever, if everything worked out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within a few weeks I felt as if I had been living in my house on the beach all my life. . . . </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They said I was wild. I wore nothing but a bikini and boots all day long and danced about with the weight gone from around my shoulders.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Liberia, Simone shook off the shackles of fame, but kept its privileges. She was given a cook, a gardener, a driver; Lisa was enrolled in the American school. She spent much of her time at Congo Beach, where she loved the sea and the cotton trees, the way the soft evening light spread above the bay like butter, the fingers of the palm fronds that reached up to the gods. And when the rainy season came—bruised clouds, the beat of coconuts on sodden sand, the stripes of lightning that cut through the night—she loved that, too. The Liberian sky was Simone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s looking glass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have seen lightning in Africa,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone said in a radio interview later featured in Garbus’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">documentary. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It electrifies you into complete speechlessness. I have seen it. I have seen God.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone was herself like a thunderstorm, and did not apologize for her irascibility. It was a beast she wouldn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t tame; she fed on its energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of a fight that Simone and Makeba got into at Steve Tolbert</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s father</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s home, Tolbert said: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a serious catfight</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were screaming at each other at the top of their lungs, pulling each other</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s hair. I think it was over a guy. It went on and on, and my father just stood there in the corner watching, laughing, and enjoying the show.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite their quarrels, Simone and Makeba were tight, and her friend set her up with Monrovia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s most eligible bachelors; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miriam didn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t give me no riff-raff,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone wrote. On her third night in town she stepped out with Philip Clarence Parker III, treasurer of the ruling True Whig Party. He owned a multimillion dollar emulsion company, Parker Paints, and he dressed in the colorful palettes he sold—a cobalt bow tie or a leopard-print cravat, always paired with a matching pocket square.</span></p>

Courtesy of the Parker family collection, Monrovia, Liberia.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My uncle Clarence was a catch,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Lester R. Parker II, his nephew, who runs an events company in Monrovia. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was Simone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s first date in Liberia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They went out a few times.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parker was an art collector. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every picture showed people in different sexual positions,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone wrote. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up, down, around, you name it. . . . [He] poured me more champagne and asked me to choose my favorite.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone didn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t do as he asked, because </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">these were early days, and I had five more men to check out before I got round to making these sorts of decisions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a spell Simone rented a villa at the Parker family compound near Congo Beach, adjacent to Sophie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s Ice Cream, a parlor that helped spark the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberianization</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">law essentially banning non-Liberians from selling ice cream in the early 1970s (the law still exists today.) A Parker family photograph shows shows Simone attending the birthday party of Wilhelmina “Coo Coo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tubman (the daughter of President Tubman) on the grounds, dressed in a halter robe that skimmed the small of her back and a pair of high Mary Janes.</span></p>
<p>Like the Tolberts, James and Doris Dennis also owned a piano, a white baby grand, and they would frequently host concerts and high-society parties at their home. Simone often spent the night there in a guest room, as she did on the Christmas Eve of 1974.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Christmas Eve we were up having a good time at the house,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dennis said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually Doris and I went to bed, but Nina stayed up. When the housekeeper came to work in the morning, she opened the door and she heard piano music. When she went further into the house she found Nina sitting at the piano in the nude, tickling the keys. Doris went down to scold her and I leant over the upstairs veranda to see what was going on. Nina went and put on a robe and came right out there and continued to serenade us with Christmas carols. I guess she was in the mood for that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she became close to Doris Dennis and another Liberian woman, Millie Buchanan, Simone was more often in male company; one woman I interviewed referred to her as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that bitch who tried to seduce my husband.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Liberia also made her more tender; she fell in love with C.C. Dennis, a freemason master, father to James Dennis and the then foreign minister, Cecil Dennis. He was seventy when they met—thirty years her senior—and had amassed a modest fortune in business, including media (he owned a newspaper, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Listener</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Simone described him as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Liberian Rhett Butler.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he was late to their first date, he left her a note: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t move. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ll be back in an hour. In Africa men are the boss. We will be married in six weeks.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone was transfixed. Dennis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer implied permanence—escape from America and a seat at Liberia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s top table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nina was very fond of my father,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said James Dennis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mother had died and my father was not attached. [She] thought that my father was just a God sent for her.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C.C. Dennis suggested an allowance of $25,000 a year, and wanted to fly in Simone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s Steinway from Barbados. At his farm estate in Bong county </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the House in the Hills”), she was instructed to wear a lacy nightgown all weekend long. But it was all talk, mostly to elevate Dennis’s reputation among his farmhands. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t know what the hell to do in order to make him hard,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone wrote in her memoir. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could marry this man, live in his crazy mansion and be happy doing it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. . . . </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notion of spending the rest of my life that way, never playing in public again, never going back to America, stretched out before me and it was a serious notion, it was a real possibility. I knew C.C. meant what he said; if only I could bring him to life and make him feel man enough to want to take on a new wife.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her body knew what her mind did not; she couldn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t marry Dennis. Exhausted both physically and emotionally, her relationship with Lisa became strained. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My mother] went from being my comfort to the monster in my life,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisa said in the documentary she produced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving Lisa in the care of James and Doris Dennis, Simone flew out of Liberia, arriving back in her childhood hometown of Tryon, North Carolina. She had planned to seek sex advice from her mother, a Methodist minister (on arrival she realized this was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an insane idea</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). While Simone was away, Dennis proposed to a mutual friend, and when she returned, he ignored her at parties. She was devastated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only once he had died that I realized the height of my stupidity, the depth of my sorrow,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">she later wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to James Dennis, the break-up hinged on much more than bad timing. “My father was reluctant to marry Nina, and not only because of the age difference,”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">he said. “He didn’t want to take on her lifestyle. She was an international musician and he was quite happy with life on his farm and occasional trips into town.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simone stayed in Liberia for two more years, becoming involved with an East African writer, Imojah, whom she described as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dark-skinned, with a voice like bells.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They dated until she and Lisa flew out of Monrovia for the final time in 1977. What pushed her to leave, in the end? Ostensibly, it was her wish to enroll Lisa in a Swiss boarding school, but perhaps it was something more. Liberia had brought release, a lick of freedom, but it hadn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t nourished her work; during her three years there she had barely recorded or performed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything I saw—the beach, the sun, the rain coming in from the sea, my friends—reminded me I was leaving it all behind, and it broke my heart,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">she wrote. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we finally flew out of Monrovia to Geneva I cried more than Lisa. I thought I was crying for Imojah but I realize now I was crying for Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . . . </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a different life.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early hours of April 12, 1980, indigenous Liberian Army soldiers loyal to the twenty-eight-year-old Sergeant Samuel K. Doe stormed the Executive Mansion, disemboweling President Tolbert, who was in his pajamas and on his way to bed, and toppling the social structure that had held in Liberia for so long. When Doe took power he promised to freeze the price of rice and gasoline (a promise that was broken when he saw the national budget) and traded Tolbert</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s limousine for a Honda Civic, winning support among the Krahn ethnic group in particular. Ten days later, his administration paraded thirteen former government ministers through the streets of Monrovia and tied them to poles on the beach behind the Barclay Training Center, where soldiers drunk on cane juice shot each man down. Among those killed were Philip Clarence Parker, Simone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s first date, and foreign minister Cecil Dennis, the son of C.C. and brother of James. Heartbroken, C.C. died two weeks later.</span></p>
<p>The Monrovia of the mid-1970s, the city that Simone had loved so hard, broke into pieces. The old center could not hold. Many members of the educated elite left for America. They’d believed they were breathing fresh political air into the country. But perhaps it had flowed no further than the confines of their own circle, which swelled like an overblown balloon and then burst.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eddie Dunn, the nightclub owner, said the narrative was more complex than that offered by Doe and his illiterate soldiers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t want to say that the period of enjoyment in the 1970s caused what came after it, although perhaps some people might say it did,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are extremes of wealth in every city in the world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His brother, Elwood Dunn, the minister </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who escaped execution only because he had fortuitously traveled to Nairobi, said that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tolbert was permissive and liberal, and others were seeking to undercut what he was doing. They thought he was going to run the country into the ground. The opposition opposed with abandon. They said, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can say whatever we want to say; the chips will fall where they will.’ And the chips did fall.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the country crumpled into civil war, Simone moved to Switzerland—the antonym of Liberia, with its white winters, symmetrical peaks, and carefully measured minutes (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I swear all ten million Swiss citizens go to bed at exactly nine o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clock each night,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">she wrote). Her own downward spiral into mental illness would come, underpinned by grief for Liberia and her lovers there, for her father, and for herself, Eunice Waymon, the black concert pianist erased by an unjust racial order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About forty years have passed since Simone left Monrovia. For fourteen of them, the city was gripped by civil war; she never knew its end, dying at her home in Bouches-du-Rh</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ô</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ne, France, on April 21, 2003, four months before the peace agreement was signed. (Her ashes were scattered over several African countries.) Now Monrovia is recovering from the Ebola outbreak, another kind of war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its slowly swelling population, Monrovia is a city that still acts like a village; a town of tight cliques and, for the elite and those with friends in high places, few fixed rules. It no longer has a downtown party strip, only a scattering of central Monrovia bars that serve </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gana gana</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a sweet cane juice brew, and cold bottles of Club beer (on nights when the Liberia Electricity Company is functioning). The Maze, the discotheque where Simone danced nude, still stands, sandwiched between My Wife</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s Business</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and Sunshine Jewelry Shop</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on the corner of Carey and Mechlin Streets. A steep staircase leads up to the original wraparound balcony, now sagging and stuffed with men</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s clothing for sale—knock-off suits, overshined loafers, and art silk bow ties manufactured by a brand called Verie God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, there</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s nowhere as much fun to dance as that place, although upscale clubs and bars are opening in the expensive neighborhood of Sinkor. (The gap between privileged and ordinary Liberians is still the elephant in the room at every fancy bar or party.) New spots are coming to Mamba Point, a seaside community where the forest still clings to the cliffs and mossy braids of lianas brush against the hills. Eventually that foliage too will be stripped away; green yielding to gray as new concrete is poured.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The old stories are still in circulation, told over and over again, thinning a little with each exchange like the downy American dollars still used as currency. And every week or so, luminaries from the 1970s—former government officials, thought leaders, journalists—meet at a dumboy joint on the lip of the city. They share quarts of whisky and soupy, lime-washed stews.</p>
<p>Among them is James Dennis. As ninety nears he remains warm and principled, as sharp and elegant as a tie pin. After the 1980 coup he moved to Tennessee, returning home to Monrovia decades later to assess the damage. He lost friends, his two homes were stripped by looters, his bank account sucked dry by the cost of constructing another life—one that would never, could never, be as good as the first.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, people are regretting that [the coup] ever happened, because everybody of any consequence left Liberia,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said on a recent Saturday evening. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those days were glorious. Now look, look what we have. I lost every single thing that I had developed in Liberia. The country was brain-drained and it never recovered. I didn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t accept it; I resented it. What could I do? What can I do?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p>Dennis holds up the 1980 coup like a mirror, scrutinizing the events that prefaced it and their modern-day parallels: a staggering social gap and a distrust of government so sweeping that it fueled the Ebola outbreak.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had this current government used more older people, I don</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t believe that we would have the problems we have today,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The younger people are grafted; they</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ll do anything for money, whereas an older person has his character to defend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p>He has advice for the current Johnson-Sirleaf administration ahead of its October 2017 exit: Be honest to the people. Let them know the truth. Create no unnecessary fantasies. And go about your activities slowly but surely, for you cannot take on everything at once—choose one thing at a time, and do it well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the city that Simone and her friends loved has been wrested away, but everywhere now I find pieces of it. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s in the way the light hits the old stained-glass window in the cadaverous E.J. Roye auditorium, the lingering crystals of rain on a wet-season windshield, or at the bottom of a well of pepper soup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a recent evening at The Capital Rooms, a luxury Mamba Point bar with a humidor and a dress code, a polished crowd filled the suspended deck. They were mostly repatriated Liberians in their twenties and thirties—repats, not expats—with American college degrees but nagging dreams of home. Bartenders in plaid shirts served Moscow Mules and Mint Juleps stuffed with Liberian sugar cane and spearmint. It was a far cry from Hibiscus or The Maze—nobody stripped down to their bones, or even their boots, that night—but if Simone were still living, still here, perhaps she might have joined them, might have sat at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">black baby grand in the corner and sang: “I wish I could know how it would feel to be free.” In Liberia, for a moment, she knew.</span></p>

She lived in a big white house in South Orange, New Jersey. My aunt and uncle and cousins would visit, too; the adults would gather in the kitchen, where they ate cashews and drank screwdrivers, and my brother and my cousins and I would go to the den. In the den was a shiny roll-top desk with brass handles. We called it the candy desk. It had been my grandfather’s, the epicenter of his storied asceticism, but then he died and my grandmother threw out his papers and filled the drawers with candy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We weren’t supposed to touch the desk—my grandmother would dole out its contents, stingily, at the end of the night—but, because we were bored, we would break the rule and roll back the top and take fistfuls of whatever was inside. The sight of those glittering foils and clear plastic wrappers gave rise to a feeling I later came to associate with the promise of sex. But there wasn’t much to be excited about. They were hard candies, off-brand, the kind only an old woman would buy. I remember the deep amber of a molasses log; I remember a white oval with a flowery tang, like dish soap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the closest garbage was in the kitchen (where the adults were, with their cashews and screwdrivers), we would ball up the wrappers and flick them into the shadowy slot between the desk and the wall. Many wrappers must have piled up there over the years. Then we would sprawl across the overstuffed couch cushions, and my little brother and I would listen in amazement as our cousins spoke of the many outrages of their school, especially the music teacher who had been taken to prison for trying to kiss a child. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After dinner, if it was summer, which often it was, my cousins and brother would go to the TV room to watch a Turner Classic Movie, and I went out to the rock. The rock was in the front yard. It was a big rock, a wide hump of gray stone with quartz marbling, the size and shape of a breaching whale. It was doleful and ungiving, yet also possessed an extraterrestrial mystery—identical, I felt sure, to the surface of the moon. That year, a satellite with blue wings named Clementine had been sent to the moon to find ice</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Looking up at the royal sky that arced over my grandmother’s weather vane (a tin rooster), I could make out a little white dot; I imagined I was working parallel to the blue-winged Clementine, that we were both hovering over a lifeless stone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once, on the drive back to Westchester, my brother asked what I’d been doing out there. “Relaxing,” I said. “Thinking.” “You can think inside,” said my brother, and in the dark of the back seat, I reached over and pinched him. The car fell silent, and then my mother said, “You </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">spend a lot of time out there. Your cousins must think you don’t like them.” I didn’t like my cousins—that was true—but it wasn’t why I went out to the rock. I went out to the rock because I’d read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Albert Einstein: Young Thinker</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and I knew what I wanted from life—to be an eccentric, an ascetic, and a genius. And I wanted to be like my grandfather, who had also been an eccentric, an ascetic, and a genius, and who had sometimes stayed up all night, at the candy desk, drafting letters to clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I went out to the rock, crouched in the twilight, and poked around in the fissures with the stick end of my bubble wand. I extracted pebbles from the fissures and examined them for oddities; if they met certain criteria, I put them in my shorts pocket. I forget what I was looking for; pebbles that glittered, I think, or pebbles that were smooth. I found very little besides pebbles. An insect’s wing, once, with dark lines running through it. I found a beetle that looked alive, but it was dead. I swept all of it into a pile. On the long drive home, after the car had fallen silent, I stuck my hand in my pocket and felt my treasures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The little red bugs weren’t a discovery, really, but something I started noticing and could not stop noticing. They were bright red and very small, and if you looked closely with your bubble wand you could see: each had six legs. They seemed to possess little intentionality; as far as I could tell, they operated only in a mode of frenzied wandering. Sometimes the red bugs would be immediately evident, but sometimes they wouldn’t appear at all. And sometimes they would appear, then disappear, and just as soon appear again. I would kill a few with my thumb, but the others seemed to take no notice. And had I even killed the ones I’d killed? There would be no mark on the rock, no mark on my thumb, no evidence of any kind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Sunday, after saying hello to Grandma Beatrice, hugging her, and getting kissed on the cheek, I asked if I could borrow a jar. “A jar of what?” she said. We were standing in the foyer. The adults stared down at me. “A jar with nothing in it,” I said. “For a science project.” I followed Grandma Beatrice into the kitchen, where she brought down a jar from the pantry. It was the exact kind of jar I wanted: a glass jar with a metal screw-top. “Your grandfather used to pickle herring in these,” she said. “I hate herring, and fish of all kind.” “Thank you, Grandma Beatrice,” I said, and I took the jar out to the rock. I sat and waited for the bugs. It was dusk. A light came on in the attic window of the house. Who was up there? I saw the dark swoop of a ceiling fan behind the curtain. Above the window was the tin rooster; above the tin rooster was the big sky, a herd of clouds, Clementine</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When I looked back to the rock, the bugs had appeared; they swarmed over the hard wrinkles. I put the jar down, but they moved around it. Eventually, I got a few on my finger and flicked them into the jar. I closed the lid and went inside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My brother and cousins were in the TV room. “I made a discovery,” I said, holding up the jar for them to see. No one looked. My cousins were angry about their parents’ divorce and never wanted to pay attention to anything. I had to wait for a commercial, and even then only my brother looked. He was younger, and, in those days, deferential. “What is it?” he said. “Bugs,” I told him. He took the jar and held it close to his face. I watched his expression through the glass; his mouth stretched across the curve of it. “I don’t see any bugs,” he said. I took the jar back from him. There was some dirt at the bottom, leaf flakes, but otherwise, he was right—it was empty. “I think they escaped,” I explained, though the lid was closed tightly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I brought the jar into the kitchen. Here were the adults: my mother sat next to my father, and my uncle sat across from my mother. My mother’s hand rested on my uncle’s, on the tabletop. Nobody was speaking. I noticed that my uncle wasn’t wearing his glasses—and then I saw them, stems folded, next to a Pyrex dish of cashews. “I’m returning Grandma Beatrice’s jar,” I said. But it was as though they hadn’t heard me. “Where’s Grandma Beatrice?” “Upstairs,” said my father. “She’s resting.” I emptied the dirt into the trash, put the jar in the sink, and then I went to the den, to the candy desk, and slid back the roll-top. It was the usual assortment: hard candies and lozenges. I scanned the drawer for a Kit-Kat, or maybe a Reese’s Cup, or even one of those tiny square Milky Ways, but there wasn’t anything like that. I stuffed a fistful of the candy into my pocket, and went back through the kitchen, keeping my head down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the TV room, I sat on the floor next to my brother. I plucked the candies from my pocket one at a time. I tried not to crunch the hard ones—I thought I might learn to appreciate the adult flavors. On the television, sailors struggled to lift a net of fish from the ocean. A man in a knit cap gripped the railing of a storm-tossed ship. I sucked on a white oval. “Coconut,” I whispered. “Tropical relaxation.” The white oval, shrunk to a sliver, slipped down my throat. I unwrapped another candy: a dark-red globe. I put it in my mouth. The taste was deep and bitter; repulsed, I swallowed it whole. Partway down, it stuck. I couldn’t breathe! Fish flopped senselessly on the deck. I reached to touch my brother’s thigh, but my arm wasn’t long enough. Just as the panic began to whirl in me, the candy slid down, and I gasped. The knit-cap man chopped a boat rope with a hatchet. I looked at my brother and cousins. No one had noticed. I looked out the sliding glass doors, toward the rock, but it was dark; all I could see was our reflection in the glass. Above us, I thought I heard the tin rooster creaking. “This movie is incredibly boring,” I said, strangely happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long after, on a Saturday morning, at our own house, my father set the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> next to my placemat. “I thought you might be curious,” he said, pointing with his spatula at the headline: &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spacecraft Malfunction May Thwart Mission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; “The little Clementine spacecraft,” I read, “which completed mapping the Moon and left lunar orbit a week ago, has suffered a serious malfunction . . .” It had gathered the data on lunar ice, then left the Moon’s orbit to explore a potato-shaped stone called Geographos. But on the way to Geographos, it had set its thrusters on high, gone into a spin, and bled out its fuel supply into space. Why? “The cause is under investigation,” read the article. I was disgusted with the satellite, disgusted with the image in my mind: a stocky robot, careening embarrassingly into the eternal. “I don’t care,” I said, but my father ignored me; he was bent over the sizzling griddle.  </span></p>
<div class="asterisks">* * *</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years and years and years later, Grandma Beatrice was diagnosed with plasma cell myeloma. When we visited her at Sloan-Kettering, her blond hair was stuck to her forehead with sweat. “If I had known you were all coming to see me,” she said, “I would have worn my pearls.” It really was all of us. My uncle leaned against the door. My cousins sat in chairs. My father stood at Grandma Beatrice’s bedside. My mother stood opposite my father, and smiled a close-lipped smile, as though politely enduring the inanities of a child. She brushed my grandmother’s hand with the back of her own. Grandma Beatrice’s hand lay on her chest, half-curled and bulging with veins, like a thing that, itself, was sick and dying. “That’s a nice thought,” said my mother. And then, after a moment, she said, “You had beautiful pearls.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That summer, our family sold Grandma Beatrice’s house and divided up her things. My mother and father got a set of silverware in a blue plush case, some ivory miniatures, and the Haggadahs. My brother, who lived on a tree farm in Rapid City, South Dakota, got a stack of deteriorating cloth-bound tomes; although, as far as I know, the tomes stayed in the basement of my parents’ house. I got a desk. It wasn’t until, standing on the curb with it, on a cool day in February, I realized what desk it was. “This is a beautiful desk,” said my father, running his hand over the wood. “Look at the inlays.” We’d driven from South Orange to Brooklyn in a U-Haul. Now we were in front of my new home, which was the top floor of a big house on a wide block, in a neighborhood that had once been rich and was now poor. The next day I would start in the office where I am right now typing, where I am in charge of estimating resource utilization, in charge of populating spreadsheets with orange labels, and, less officially, in charge of resolving the fruit fly problem in the kitchenette. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had taken some time to get the desk out of the U-Haul, and we still needed to carry it up three flights of stairs. We brought it from the curb to the front porch. We put it down again. My father leaned on the porch railing; he took deliberate breaths, and seemed to consider the desk anew. “This was your grandfather’s,” he said, knocking on the grooves of the roll-top. “He would fall asleep at it with a cigarette in his hand. And your grandmother would come down in the morning, and yell at him for having gotten ash all over it, and probably damaging the finish.” A moment later he added, “Your grandmother was a very interesting woman. She used to sing opera. Not professionally, of course.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I propped open the door with a planter, and we lifted the desk again, and started up the stairs. I was in front, and moved up the stairs backwards; my father had the other end. After a few steps, I noticed he was breathing heavily, and that his face had turned red. He bared his teeth. He was sweating. When we got to the second floor landing, he said, “Hold on,” and we put the desk down again. The wood seemed to sparkle. “I think he bought it at an estate sale,” said my father. “We used to call it The Girls’ Names Desk.” He ran his hand along a brass handle. He needed a break, I saw, after only one flight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Girls’ Names Desk?” I said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes,” said my father, “look,” and he slid back the roll-top, then pulled out a drawer to which I had never given much thought. The drawer was empty, and its wooden bottom was carved up. There were girls’ names, maybe twenty of them, written in jagged cursive: Clara, Edna, Su——, Willa, Jane; some were illegible. We stood there and looked at the names, and then my father said, “Your grandfather and his brother, before either of them got married, lived together in the city. They fought all the time. And they were womanizers. They competed to see who could sleep with the most girls. Whenever they slept with one, the next morning they’d carve her name into the bottom of this drawer.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked for “Beatrice” among the names, but couldn’t find it. My grandfather was dead, so was my grandmother, and my great-uncle was senile, and the girls—Clara, Edna, Willa—they must have all been dead or close. And my father would be dead, too, in a year, from Hodgkin’s lymphoma. But I didn’t know that yet. Something glinted in a corner of the desk, and I reached, expecting to retrieve an ancient candy wrapper, but what I came back with was cold and hard: a golden coin. My father leaned over, and, together, we considered the emblazoned image: a chubby cat with a curlicue tail and a mischievous smile on its face. Was the cat winking? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fat Black Sally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said the words above the cat. “That’s a silly thing,” said my father. It occurred to me that we had been standing on the second floor landing for a long time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That last stretch was the most difficult. My father and I switched positions—I took up the rear, pushing against the full weight of the desk, and my father stood above me, stepping up and back, guiding our progress. As we managed up the stairs, a spasm broke across my father’s face—he winced—and I moved to help him. A drawer shot out from the desk, cleared the runners, and banged past us down the stairs. We froze. The desk swayed. I thought it had been the Girls’ Names drawer, but it had been a different drawer. “Dammit,” said my father, although without much conviction. Then, as though waking from a trance, he blinked. “What was that?” he said. “I just saw green.” But he didn’t mention it again. We resumed our climb. Past my father, I could see the open door of my new apartment; through the door, a kitchen, a smudgy window, a gleaming stove. And past all that was the living room, where we planned to set the desk down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it wasn’t so simple—the living room was crowded with moving boxes, and it took us a long time to find a place where the desk would fit. Eventually, we pushed it into a corner, where it blocked a shelf. Then we sat on the couch. We were exhausted, and neither of us had the heart to point out the obvious—the desk was not meant for this space. It was a haughty antique, especially compared to the things of my new apartment, where my roommate, A., had already been living for several days. What had he managed to accumulate? There were IKEA chairs and milk crates, a pile of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychology Today</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> magazines; on the windowsill sat a stunted little cactus in a terra-cotta planter. I caught myself wondering how I might remove the desk—A. could help—then, guilty, I asked my father if he remembered anything else about its past. But he was asleep. His chest rose and fell, and his breath, as it moved through his nostrils, whistled. I shook his arm. His eyelids fluttered. “Excuse me,” he said. For a moment, he seemed uncertain about where he was. Then he reached over and squeezed my hand, holding it for longer than seemed right. A shameful tenderness visited me, a deep, woozy feeling, and it lingered long after my father climbed into the U-Haul, and put on the blinker, and turned onto Rogers Avenue, headed for the drop-off. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few days, the desk became blocked in by other furniture, moving boxes, and stacks of books. I rarely saw A. When I did see him, it was in the kitchen, where he sat at the table I had brought from my last apartment, eating out of a Tupperware. There were stains on his T-shirt, and I thought this could mean he worked at a restaurant, or a bar. He had said once, but I’d forgotten. Neither of us mentioned the old desk in the common area, and in our silences, I felt the creeping pervasion of A.’s annoyance and disapproval. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a little while, I did try to make the desk part of my life. I filled out a tax form on it, ate dinner, read a magazine. I put a stack of books on top. I never really liked using it, though. It was oddly low-slung, like it had been made for a child. Cracks had formed in the varnish, a musty smell rose from it, and one of the legs wasn’t flush with the ground, so that when you leaned into the desk, it rocked and creaked. My work acquaintance, K., thought it was haunted, and maybe it was; whatever the case, I felt an obligation to it. I continued to sit at it, eat takeout, and once I pulled out the drawer to see how far back the girls’ names went. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said one, and also </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melody</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and then there was a line that said </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herb doesn’t count her</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The names continued, I saw, all the way into the back of the drawer, where it was dark. I wanted to see those names, too, so I pulled the drawer out further. But it stuck, and wouldn’t go back in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One evening, a month or so later, I came home to find the apartment transformed. The moving boxes had disappeared, the chairs were pushed against the wall, and the magazines had been stuffed into a giant mahogany bookshelf, which looked about to tip over. The cactus was still there, on the windowsill, but it had been joined by a long-stemmed flower in a glass vase. And next to the flower was a purple candle, which said </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">JINX</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the side in white letters. I noticed a pair of shoes outside A.’s door: small black ballet flats. It took me a moment to realize that the desk was gone. When I did, I felt a lightness, and maybe a kind of panic. But then there it was: sticking out from the door of my room, as though someone had tried to shove it inside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought of knocking on A.’s door, but instead I just stood outside of it, looking from the ballet flats to the dented brass knob, listening. I could hear the murmur of speech—one voice lower than the other—though I couldn’t discern any real meaning. The talk went on and on, and then it stopped, and there was a click. The light had gone off. As I stood there, something turned in me—a small, hard screw—and I reached out and knocked. A long time passed before the door opened. I stared into the dark space, and then someone spoke from it. “Hello,” said the voice. For a moment, the word seemed to bob in the air. “Hello,” I said, closing the door. In the morning—a Saturday—I lifted the desk from its spot, and in no time at all I had it down the stairs, and out on the curb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My bedroom window was street-facing, and I could see the desk from it, sitting on the stained sidewalk, surrounded by trash bags and filthy clumps of snow. Cars drove by. A leafless tree grew from a square of dirt. The few people that passed the desk seemed to ignore it. But when I looked out again a few minutes later, there was a kid standing there—a teenager, probably—pulling at one of the desk legs. As he worked, hunched over, his breath came out in white clouds. He must have been freezing; he wasn’t even wearing a coat. When the leg finally gave, there was a trebly pop, and the desk tipped into the pile of fat trash bags. And it was then that, possessed by what I can only describe as excitement, I put down my coffee, I slid open the window, and I even slid open the screen. “I saw that,” I called down to him. I didn’t mean it as an accusation, but when his face swung up to meet mine, he was frowning. “The fuck you know,” he said. Then he jogged away, holding the leg like a torch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, alone in my room, I felt some relief. It was winter, but the sun was bright and it shimmered in the glass of my window. I said a small prayer to the objects around me—the snow globe, the slide whistle, the Italian movie poster X. had given me at the end of our short, troubled relationship. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Il Furfante</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said the poster, and there was a picture of a cowboy on it, wearing spurred boots and a Stetson hat, stepping through a dark tear in the universe. His gun was drawn and the hat brim shadowed his face. A comet arced over his shoulder. I’d always thought the cowboy looked paranoid, sick with power, like some unhappy god; now, though, I saw he was merely peeking around the corner. I felt a kind of tenderness for him, and a kinship. My life was only beginning. I’d fall in love and get married, or, if that didn’t happen, I’d at least travel to Europe. An image flashed in my mind—the cat from the coin. I pushed it away, but it lingered, like a bad taste. I went on with my day: I made lunch, watched television, texted K. and S. But the cat kept returning, winking at me from the unknown. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hours later, I found myself pausing a show on my laptop, rushing outside in a robe and slippers, pulling at the Girl’s Names drawer. I got it to budge a little, and reached in, but the golden coin was gone. I tried to yank the drawer out the rest of the way, but no matter how hard I pulled, the desk held tight. I wondered if my grandfather’s spirit was hovering over me, ashamed at the state of things—his desk in the trash, his grandson in a frenzy. After a few minutes, I realized I was standing in a mound of snow; I could feel the bite of it through my slippers. As I floated up the stairs, my body thawing, a weight descended on me, a dull pressure on my shoulders and the back of my neck. I passed by A.’s door, and imagined him rolling the cat coin over his girlfriend’s naked body. I felt a little sick. I lay down in bed and stared at my phone. I scrolled through the names. Who were these people? I called my father, but he didn’t pick up. I called my brother, and after only one ring it went to voicemail.</span></p>

I had just finished my first year in graduate school in New York, and for that week in May all I did was read <i>Ulysses</i>. I didn’t have many friends, I didn’t go out, I was lonely, my roommate went home for the summer, so I stayed up reading Joyce.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I didn’t read the Gifford annotations, and often I barely knew what was happening. I did, however, understand this part, about a quarter of the way through the book: Leopold Bloom sits in Davy Byrne’s pub, eating “with relish of disgust” a Gorgonzola cheese and mustard sandwich. As he’s washing the food bits down with a glass of burgundy, he remembers the moment he proposed to his wife, Molly, at Howth Head:</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle. Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman&#8217;s breasts full in her blouse of nun&#8217;s veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I couldn’t believe it. It was one of the most beautiful passages I’d ever read.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because this is Joyce, it’s worth going over the details. The fact that Bloom and Molly are alone, the location of Howth Head (if you don’t know what it looks like, please look up pictures), that’s all very storybook romantic, but what makes this passage is the messiness of it. A goat is shitting right next to them, for heaven’s sake. And the kiss itself: Molly pushes a seedcake, which she has partially masticated, into Bloom’s mouth with her tongue, and he tastes her spittle and the stickiness of her lips. In a book about the momentous and the mundane, this passage is an intersection of both. It’s a moment that’s completely full. It’s a moment that’s alive, wriggling like a tongue.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Writing about <i>Ulysses </i>is kind of like increasing the world’s pollution. At this point, there’s so much about the book it’s difficult to tell what of it matters, and how much. It all sort of cancels itself out. In fact, there’s so much personal writing about the book <i>on top of </i>all the straightforward criticism that at this point even writing about your own feeling and reaction to <i>Ulysses </i>feels extraneous and unnecessary. Didn’t someone already say exactly what you want to say in much better words? And so how do you write about the seedcake kiss, one of the most famous moments in one of the most famous novels ever written? Thirty years ago, twenty years ago, ten years ago, didn’t some other guy in his early twenties move to the East Village and feel the pleasure of his loneliness and stay up late at night in his apartment and plow through Joyce, get to the seedcake kiss and feel the beauty of the writing positively blank out his brain, causing him to stop and reread it over and over again until he could just begin to understand why he found it so beautiful, but not for too long because he still had ten episodes to go, though he underlined it in his copy, and a month, a year later, after he’d finished the book and had read a few other books, flip through until he found it, and then read it again?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Joyce returns to the kiss 500 pages later, saving it for the final 39 lines of the entire book. By giving us how Molly remembers the kiss, the messiness propagates: “My God after that long kiss I near lost my breath… and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of.” Molly thinks of sleepy donkeys slipping, thousand-year-old castles, half-open wineshops at night, castanets, the sea, figtrees in the Alameda gardens. The seedcake kiss isn’t a representation, it’s the part of a life that we have no name for, it’s something just as important as goat currants and tired donkeys, it’s fertile potential and the thing we want more of, it&#8217;s all we have, it’s a splendid, beguiling fluke.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And then this:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I am hearing such statements again now that the Montana special elections have proven a white man can win a seat in Congress even after being formally charged with assaulting a journalist who is trying to do his job. Some people say the outcome of this election was skewed because so many ballots were cast before we knew the winner had such violent tendencies. Other people claim to be shocked at the level of violence voters will condone. I am not shocked by any of this. For quite some time—since The Beginning, really—black people have been pointing out that &#8220;this&#8221; is actually happening. Recognizing the problem at this point feels like too little too late.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I want to point out that I find myself worrying about people&#8217;s intentions almost all the time. I find myself worrying that people I like will speak words or commit acts that cause me great pain. I find myself worrying about writing about all of this. I find myself worrying that confronting this pain will make my life more difficult. I find myself staying home more and more often. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Some time ago we moved into the basement. Which feels remarkably right.</span></p>
<div class="asterisk">*</div>
<p class="p2">Our house has been torn apart. We&#8217;re renovating our master bathroom and insulating all the ceilings, floors, and walls. So we&#8217;ve been living in the basement for more than a month.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> It&#8217;s cozy down here. Part of me wants to stay forever.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> My daughter sleeps in the room that was advertised as a craft room by the sellers&#8217; real estate agent. We call it The Dot Room because, after a catastrophic hailstorm felled the guest room window, causing the rest of the basement to flood, I painted over The Dot Room&#8217;s original homogenous color scheme, tracing out a series of contrasting circles using an avocado-green Lazy Susan my mother had held on to since the &#8217;70s. That old Lazy Susan was a perfect stencil, and I still haven&#8217;t thrown it away. I come from people who can&#8217;t throw anything away.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> We use The Dot Room as an overflow guest room. There are no windows in the room, and concrete sits just behind the drywall. It&#8217;s cool and it&#8217;s dark, which makes it the perfect place to retreat from the world. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> When I was a girl in Iowa, my family home had a similar room. It wasn&#8217;t carpeted. The walls were bare concrete. Part of the reason I made sure to finish the room in our current basement is because the Iowa room almost always felt like wasted space. The sellers&#8217; agent had advertised it as a &#8216;Fraidy Room, a place where our family could retreat in case of a home-threatening storm. My parents kept wine and a few boxes there, but mostly we found ourselves in the &#8216;Fraidy Room only if tornado sirens sounded. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> What am I doing? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I&#8217;m thinking about writing about living as a black woman—the mother of a black child—in America. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I am writing about escape rooms. </span></p>
<div class="asterisk">*</div>
<p class="p2">There&#8217;s a line in my new book of essays that caused me concern for a while. It addresses the fact that my great-grandfather was—as a direct descendant described him—&#8221;damned near white.&#8221; But my great-grandfather was not white. And that is my point in my book. That was the point made clear to my great-grandfather on the threat of death. Part of my concern stemmed from the fact that a few of my friends wondered why his near-whiteness didn&#8217;t get him a pass. Wouldn&#8217;t white privilege keep him safe?</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">That&#8217;s not how it works in America. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Have yourself a biracial child in this country and put him out in the world and what you&#8217;ll have walking down the road is a black boy. Black isn&#8217;t a skin tone. It&#8217;s a condition. My great-grandfather was a black man in America and no matter who his father was or who his father&#8217;s father was or how close he toed the line to whiteness or how much he believed in his right to advance beyond the menial stations reserved for Negroes he wasn&#8217;t going to be allowed to escape his black body. Except through death. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> This great-grandfather owned a sheet-metal shop on the border that divided a dry state from a wet one. On the dry side of the shop, he built bathtubs. On the wet side of the shop, he built stills.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I&#8217;m pretty sure I know why I love this story so much. And I&#8217;m pretty sure it has something to do with a black man bending the law of the land to his will.</span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: left;"><div class="asterisk">*</div></p>
<p class="p2">It&#8217;s May, and the police have killed another child.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> This child was fifteen years old. He was leaving a party with his brother who—rather than spending the rest of the night celebrating the successful end to another school year—had to witness the last moments of his little brother&#8217;s life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> There will be plenty written about this murder. People are pointing out that he was an honors student, as if academic success should have granted him a pass from the condition of black lives in America. The police who shot this child have already claimed that his car was advancing aggressively toward the police vehicle. And video footage already shows this was not the case. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I am tired of these conversations. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I am tired of having to explain why it is not okay for police to think it is okay to kill a fifteen-year-old black boy who is sitting still in a moving car.</span></p>
<div class="asterisk">*</div>
<p class="p2">A few months ago, a local high school student contacted me because she needed to interview a professional woman whose work she admired. This was a lovely request—one I was happy to oblige.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">At the end of the interview, the girl said she had one final question: &#8220;Why do Black Lives Matter?&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I had an answer for her, but I don&#8217;t remember what it was. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I remember thinking I wanted to answer as nicely as I could because this was a sweet girl from a family I liked quite a bit and she meant no harm and there probably aren&#8217;t more than twenty black students in her entire high school, and so she had no reason to know how hurtful her question was, and it was clear from her tone that she was earnestly trying to make sense of all this, and so I&#8217;m sure I answered in a detached manner with statistical information about the disproportionate number of black people and people of color killed by police before they have a chance to undergo the due process of law, and I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t mention anything about the bias of the legal system that makes it nearly impossible for a person of color in America to experience a fair trial in this country even if they happen to be arrested by police rather than summarily killed, and I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t say to this child that another word for such summary and extrajudicial justice is lynching because I&#8217;m sure I gave her an answer that fit into a sound bite she could use in her school report and that might make a difference in her very white class in this very white town in some tepid way, and I know for a fact I didn&#8217;t curse her or curse her question though I wanted to then and have wanted to ever since. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Do you think your life matters? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Well, so do I. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> That&#8217;s what I should have said.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I think Jordan Edwards&#8217;s life matters. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I am angry he is dead.</span></p>

<p class="p2">Dear Brenda: I have started writing again after the great silencing that was the election and the installation of that person and all those who stand behind him and his supremacist notions. Now I am carrying a very small, very cheap, very inconsequential notebook, and sometimes I write things in it. It feels like something, and it also feels like nothing. Like all those calls I keep making to my senators and representatives.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Here is a photo of the little gifts you sent Callie Violet. They are leaning against a start from one of my African violets. All of the violets have done so well in our living room that they outgrew their pots. I&#8217;ve had to give them new homes. They&#8217;re struggling now. But they are hanging on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> My whole life feels like a metaphor these days.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">All love,</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Camille</span></p>
<div class="asterisk">*</div>
<p class="p2">After the ballots were counted in 2004, and after Kerry conceded, I started trying to punch white people in the mouth.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> But first I spent one too many nights in my friend&#8217;s bar. We were angry, and that night—call it election night, call it concession night—after the bar closed, we kept drinking, and then we started breaking our beer bottles on the walls and old-fashioned tiled floors. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I woke up the next morning and decided there must be a better way to fight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I joined what was supposed to be a mixed-martial-arts studio but was really a boxing gym where conservative white men could get away with kicking and punching in ways that didn&#8217;t feel too colored. We wore karate pants, but blue with black stripes. We wore T-shirts with the gym&#8217;s logo. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The gym owner never did settle on a promotion system while I was a member. First there were belts. Then there were badges. Then a different color T-shirt with every advancement. I didn&#8217;t care. The gym was directly across the road from Jerry Falwell&#8217;s Liberty University, and most of the members were Liberty affiliates. A lot of them were cops or former cops. A lot of them were also members of Jerry Falwell&#8217;s Thomas Road Baptist Church. I hated everything they stood for. Let me be clear, I didn&#8217;t hate the police or the Fundamentalists or the individual men. I repudiated the notions of intolerance and unequal protection and isolationism they claimed to stand behind. Though they really liked me personally—as they told me repeatedly between sparring sessions—they also professed to hate everything that I believed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Two hours a night, Monday through Thursday (and sometimes Fridays and Saturdays, too), we kicked the hell out of each other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Goddamn, but that felt good.</span></p>
<div class="asterisk">*</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The morning after the 2016 election, my husband pulled all our blinds closed, and they have stayed that way ever since. Maybe the basement feels right to me now because I can&#8217;t look outside even when I&#8217;m not below ground.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Beyond the blinds I have a garden that I love. For three years I have been pulling rocks from the hardscaped beds, mixing compost and soil into the red Colorado clay I find beneath. I&#8217;ve reclaimed large sections of the lawn and converted those to flower beds as well. In November my sunflowers were still bright, as were the four o&#8217;clocks and the late-blooming perennials—the hyssop and the mums. I used to open the blinds every morning so I could look out at my garden all day. But it&#8217;s hard to know what passersby might think if they catch a glimpse of our home’s interior. Much of the art is from the African Diaspora. There are portraits of a satisfied black family all over the walls, many of them painted by a professional artist. My husband doesn’t keep our blinds closed, because he is afraid we&#8217;ll be robbed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> He is afraid we might be killed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> For the second time in my little notebook, I find a note that reads: &#8220;It occurs to me that the person who took the time to share the idea that just because you&#8217;re paranoid doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not out to get you might well have been black.”</span></p>
<div class="asterisk">*</div>
<p class="p2">Right after the election, I started to want to learn my way around a gun.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Not to kill anyone. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Just in case— while we were on the run—someone dropped near us and I had to grab a gun from the body without breaking stride. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I want to know what to do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I want to know how to clean a gun and load a gun and how to fix myself against a gun&#8217;s recoil. I want to know what it&#8217;s like to breathe in and pull the trigger as I exhale. Not because I want to use a gun against someone. But because I am afraid of a gun being used against someone I love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I told this to a couple of writer friends one afternoon in February. How I thought it would be a good idea to join a gun club, like I joined the boxing gym. Then I told them what worried me—that if I walked my black body into a gun club and started shooting this could easily turn into one of those stories where a black person ended up dead and the narrative would be spun so that my death was my own fault. Maybe I needed to find a white friend to take the lessons with me, I said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The woman in this conversation thought this gun-club experience would make a great essay. She thought I shouldn&#8217;t take anyone with me. Bringing along a white companion would skew all my interactions in the club.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> &#8220;Is this about getting material for an essay?&#8221; my male friend asked. &#8220;Or is it about keeping Camille safe?&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I thought his response meant my friend understood the big picture as it related to the precarious position of black lives in America. But not half an hour later, when the conversation turned to the racial hostilities revealed in this country after the election, he said, &#8220;This is all just so surprising!&#8221; and &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think this could actually happen!&#8221; And I realized he wasn&#8217;t seeing the big picture at all.</span></p>
<div class="asterisk">*</div>
<p class="p2">I went to my daughter&#8217;s school on what felt like the first day of spring. The girls were all in sundresses. No one wore socks. I noticed the grass had turned green.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Four blondes played tetherball—two per court. One black girl stood off to the side. I thought she said, &#8220;Can I play the next game?&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I thought I heard one of the blondes answer, &#8220;Tomorrow? Sure.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> On the steps to the school grounds, someone had carefully chalked these words. They were a threat, or a promise: </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">THE WORLD IS CHANGING.</span></p>
<div class="asterisk">*</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> We almost moved out of the basement, but the nozzle on our new shower is calibrated incorrectly. It&#8217;s impossible to heat the water past lukewarm because the temperature gauge is fixed between hot and cold.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> We will have to call the handyman, but I don&#8217;t want to trouble him over the weekend. The workweek will start soon enough. He can try to fix the problem then.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> As we went to sleep on the lower level, two of us in the guest room and one in the storm shelter, I thought about my great-grandfather who built bathtubs because that&#8217;s what the law allowed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I bet he would have fixed this if he could. </span></p>

It was a couple of summers ago in New York. I had spent a few days shrink-wrapped by anxiety, my mind blurred and alienated. I walked past the gallery and felt a pull, an invisible open signal, and so I entered. About ten black-and-white works, taken in the early 20th century, hung eye-level on the wall, each presenting a stranger with a face that I instantly recognized. The alluring painter’s wife, knowing what she does about sexual desire, in her loose pants. The young secretary with her hunched shoulders and defensive glare. The high school student, in the wrong clothes and the wrong life. The arrogance and abject denial of the soldier, under his helmet and in front of his land. All of them very different, but each with a simple stare, their inner selves resonating through these one-dimensional representations of their long ago lives and into mine. In their image, I began to regain a sense of my world. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What made his subjects look at him like this? In his self-portraits, Sander, born in 1876 in a small village near Cologne, seems shy and slight. He discovered his medium by chance, and took an apprenticeship. His obsession with personality and typology led him to begin work on a lifetime project, “Faces of the Twentieth Century”, in which he planned to photograph as many Germans as possible, in the most realistic terms, and categorize them into groups: “The Farmer,” “The Skilled Tradesman,” “The Woman,” “Classes and Professions,” “The Artists,” “The City,” and “The Last People.” During this period—post World War I—this was not seen as presumptuous, elitist, or racist: the idea of being able to detect, for example, criminality via physical appearance was taken seriously, a sociological gesture for the community. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alongside this methodological and reductive approach, Sander described his work as a search for truth, a reach essential for a greater understanding of humanity. His academic words belie an exalted, mystical tone: “All things that happen have their appearance, or ‘face’, and an event’s total appearance is its physiognomy,” he said in a 1931 radio lecture, adding, “We know that people are formed by the light and air, by their inherited traits, and their actions… A well-known poem says that every person’s story is written plainly on his face, although not everyone can read it. These are the runes of a new, but likewise an ancient, language.” Objectifying his sitters was impossible: seeing them, understanding them exactly for who they were with no judgement, was crucial to his process.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Uptown, near the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Hauser &amp; Wirth Gallery is currently showing forty portraits, all taken between 1910 and 1931. These specific works were among those re-printed in large-scale format by Sander’s son Gunther, for an exhibition “Men Without Masks: Faces of Germany 1910 – 1938” at the Mannheimer Kunstverein in 1973. That show was an effort to revive discussion around his father, who despite finding widespread popularity with his first publication, “Face of Our Time” in 1929, had to leave Cologne after the demise of the Weimar Republic. While some have since argued that Sanders’ concept of categorization encroaches too much with the far left’s classification system, the Nazis saw it differently: The book was removed from circulation and the original plates destroyed. New work, much of it from “Faces of the Twentieth Century” was later lost in a fire. His son, Erich, died in prison after being put away for his political resistance. Sander never returned to portraiture, and died in 1964. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Among our contemporary masters, he is considered a genius who invented portraiture, but his reputation doesn’t extend much further than that—a problem singular to the medium, explained Olivier Renaud-Clément, who curated the show. Hauser &amp; Wirth recently announced their worldwide representation of the August Sander Family Foundation, a deliberate move to push Sander’s photography into its rightful spot in the art marketplace. “Why would you differentiate a good drawing by Louise Bourgeois from a good photograph by Sander? This is still happening,” said Renaud-Clément. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Visiting this new exhibition—this time open and prepared, surrounded by the throng—I found the same locking of the gaze and intense stillness of these encounters. On the second floor is the full “Portfolio of Archetypes” of the people of Stamm-Mappe, the first set that Sander photographed using his conceptual parameters. Elderly inhabitants from his home village, most of them laborers, farmers, peasants, their lives beginning to be imposed upon by industrialization, some wearing new, uncomfortable suits, others in traditional clothing; </span><span class="s1">many grasping bibles, burning in their clear hands. Their grasp may be antiquated, but the conviction in their fingers is the same as yours. Downstairs, the porter’s suit may be old fashioned, but the fraying at the edge of his jacket is not. The varnisher is framed by ancient walls and rendered whole by the evidence of years of craftmanship. Our painter’s wife, here with her daughter in their modern home, reveals herself as a woman who will confront anyone who might consider her progressive values detrimental to her parental love. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Taken around 1926, this image identifies the cultural shifts and divides of a country experiencing the sudden but vanishing artistic bloom amid democratic idealism: political perhaps, but her pose, like all the others, suggests possibility, a sense of being seen. He allows his subjects to identify themselves in fundamental ways, and in these faces we spy not just the inevitable signs of class, labor, heritage, education, or privilege, but we see those in our lives whom we miss, regret, adore, despise, fear, and cherish. Truth is unmovable, unchangeable, and with Sander’s eye, captured in light and air.</span></p>

The audience can tell that a rare and radiant performance is about to occur. So fluid and complete is the communion of this musician to her instrument, so beautiful is her tone, that her playing is the very definition of virtuosity, the essence of musical sublimity.</p>
<p>Not only does she appear on concert stages, at jazz clubs and festivals all over the world, but she has brought her prodigious talent to some pretty unusual venues, as well: the roof of Oslo’s City Hall for a moving memorial performance; the top of a mountain; a spare, darkened room for an intense, indelible “New York Times: In Performance.”</p>
<p>Her recordings are ventures in vision, with each CD offering a different facet of her versatile instrument. She performed four of the greatest trumpet concertos on her eponymous and acclaimed debut CD; while on <em>Tine</em>, she gave us the trumpet’s lyric voice and the awesome Hindemith Trumpet Sonata. On <em>Storyteller</em>, she transcribed songs with words into pure, emotive sound. Her beautiful Christmas album, <em>My Heart Is Ever Present</em>, is a perennial best seller abroad. She plays contemporary composers, Philip Glass, Arvo Pärt, and others too numerous to cite. She has even curated the Tine@Munch Music Festival at the Munch Museum in Oslo, bringing music, art, and writing together. Helseth&#8217;s creative appetite for delving and communicating continues to spill over. She most recently toured in Europe, playing the natural trumpet, an early instrument.</p>
<p>Her worldwide fans adore her, following her every move on social media. She generously gives them a close-up look at her career and the “strange life,” as she calls it, of a touring soloist. She takes them onstage and behind the scenes to rehearsals, dressing rooms, and practice sessions. She takes them under the supposed glamour to early morning wake-up calls, ironing boards, bad-hair days, yet another airport lounge. She shares all this and more with free-spirited joy, some self-deprecating wit, and a touch of healthy irreverence.</p>
<p>I spoke to Helseth at her New York City hotel on a rainy morning in late March. She was almost at the end of a cross-country tour with her all-female brass ensemble, tenThing, yet she patiently answered my rather abstract questions with integrity, affecting honesty, and eloquence. Here is what this inspiring artist had to say about music, the language of life.</p>
<p><em>—Emily Fragos for </em>Guernica</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>You have said that musicality lies deeper than any instrument. You’re famous for your exquisite sensitivity to tone, shaping, and phrasing. Are you wired from birth with this gift, can it be partially taught, are you inspired by others, and can you learn from them?</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth: </strong>I think you have to be born with it to some extent. You need to have it in you, so you can reach it. At the same time, musicality evolves over time with everything you experience. You definitely acquire several layers when you experience life. You discover more feelings inside yourself, and then you have the ability to transform them, to bring those feelings into your instrument, your voice, and then to get that across. That’s how you develop. With each experience, you have more to tell, more to show. The more I know about myself and the world, the more I’ll continue to develop musically and as a person, until I am not here anymore. It never stops. Everything is completely connected.</p>
<p>For instance, two years ago, I was away from the stage for half a year. I was exhausted. I hit the wall and was quite ill. When I came back and started to play again, people who played with me before and after said that I was completely new in everything I did. I like to think that music is <em>the</em> most important thing to me, but at the same time, pardon my language, I don’t give a fuck. No one dies. Do things. Be there in the moment. There is so much more to life.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> Dancers speak of having a compulsive, internal response to music, even though their outer selves may appear calm. They might feel excited, chaotic, euphoric. You’re so composed on stage, but I wonder if, as an instrumentalist, you have a visceral, invisible response to music.</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth: </strong>I think to some degree, yes, but it’s a little bit different for me, of course. How to explain: it’s like my language somehow. No matter what type of music I hear or play, it feels like I belong and I understand it. I appreciate all kinds of music in that way. It’s a language I understand. I feel it deep inside of me.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> Many performers say that being on stage is a secure place, because life might clobber you over the head and people might betray you, but music never does.</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> I’m most vulnerable onstage and, at the same time, it’s my safe place. It’s where I’m not scared of anything; I’m not scared of life. I feel secure there. I feel like it’s in some way an escape from everyday madness. I’m in my bubble. I can get in touch with hard feelings, bad feelings, but I can do it without falling apart, in which case I can’t play. I can feel them without feeling them. It’s very strange. The feelings come through the instrument and not through me, so I’m not overwhelmed. I can channel them somehow.</p>
<p>What I want is to be an honest artist; I want what I do to be me. I don’t want to do extravagant phrasing just to show off. I’ve played with wonderful musicians who’ve played beautifully, but the phrasing wasn’t coming from inside of them. I don’t want to be like that. I want it to be honest, raw.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>What do you mean by raw?</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> Unfiltered, no hiding, more naked somehow. Honest, naked, raw. It’s just me.</p>
<div class="responsive-embed-wrapper"><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FCcZ90NWHZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>Everyone talks about the inimitable voice you put out. May I read a quote by Miles Davis about his own trumpet voice?</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> Sure, fire away. I like Miles Davis and Chet Baker, too, my two favorites.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> “I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it. I like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle, clear and clean straight through. If I can’t get that sound, I can’t play anything.”</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> I do understand what he means by being in the middle of his sound, of his instrument. You should always be in the middle of it. In another way, I want my instrument to be able to show every aspect of my register of feelings, different timbres, different colors, atmospheres&#8230;<em>everything</em>. At the same time, being in the middle of the sound, the instrument, I see that as being a “me” kind of thing. In that way, I can relate. If I’m not in the middle of my sound, if it’s not my sound, then it’s not honest.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> Does it fail you sometimes? Can you always get that sound?</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> Of course, there are times when you’re not feeling at your best—embouchure-wise. When it doesn’t come as easy to me, when I’m not in good shape, I really have to focus on it.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> Your trumpet voice has been hailed by many as being the most beautiful in the world, described, in part, as shimmering, soft, burnished, supra-lucid, poetic, able to access emotional extremes—from great joy to great sorrow—and the wide gamut of human emotion in between. When you play adagios, your voice can sound otherworldly, haunted, as if you have been abandoned on the moon.</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> I want it to be <em>my</em> voice; that is the most important thing. I teach at the Academy in Oslo, and I tell my students: &#8220;Of course, you need technique, you need to learn all the scales, you need to have all of that in your box of tools, but what’s important in the end is this: <em>really</em> treasure your voice.&#8221; People ask, “What do you listen to? Who do you want to be like?” I don’t want to be anyone. I want to be <em>me</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>People get obsessed with the brand of trumpet you play, the mouthpiece, the mute, the practice equipment you use. In a radio interview, you once said, in exasperation, “It’s not the trumpet! It’s an instrument; it’s a tool made of metal. It is <em>me</em> playing. It is <em>my</em> voice.”</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> Good equipment is important so you can do what you want to do, but I am always asked, “What kind of trumpet do you play? It sounds <em>really</em> good.” It’s not the trumpet, it’s <em>me</em>. No matter what type of trumpet you give me, it’ll always sound like me. I still use the B-flat trumpet my mom gave me a long time ago. I might need to change it. It’s getting old. The mouthpiece is worn. I don’t know, I like it.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> A lot of people are intimidated by classical music for various reasons. You’re intent on taking down the walls between stage and audience, bringing disenchanted people back to the concert halls. Young people are flocking to meet you and to hear you play.</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> It’s horrible, those walls. First of all, I come from a very normal, average family. We didn’t have a lot of money when I was growing up, and I’m the first professional musician in my family. At recitals I talk in between pieces, I make jokes. The minute I open my mouth to speak, the whole boundary between me and the audience flies out the window, vanishes, and I’m suddenly on their level, even though I’m up there on stage. I <em>am</em> on their level.</p>
<p>I’m not superhuman. I have my flaws, my vulnerabilities; I’m scared of things. I want the audience to see that. I have some abilities, and playing-wise I have an extreme ability to show all these human emotions, but I can show these emotions because I’m a vulnerable human being. You can’t say I’m a normal person—who’s normal anyway—because of my musical gift; but, at the same time, at the end of the day, I’m just like them, the same.</p>
<p>I want the audience to feel that they can experience something special and get in touch with a range of emotions when they listen to me. I want them to be entertained—which sounds like a bad word—but be entertained in the <em>best</em> way. I would like them to just feel: “OK, this is where I am right now. I don’t want to think about other things, like the stress of work, or whatever.” I would like the audience to be a part of something and not because I’m standing up there. I want to be on their level.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> When you tour with your all-female brass ensemble, tenThing, you often take your music out of the concert hall and into other venues like the mall, plazas, and public schools.</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> We’ve done a lot of school concerts and workshops. I remember one boy who heard us play and his mouth dropped open for half an hour. What a reaction. The kids were all smiling. After concerts, I’m tired and I have to do a signing. Then I come out there and people come up to me and young people especially make an impression when they say, “I’ve been following you since I was a kid and you’re an inspiration to me. You’re the reason I play. I’ll listen to you forever.” Of course, I have to go out and meet them. It makes my day to know that I have that ability.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> The late pianist Glenn Gould gave up performing in person. For one thing, he felt he played his best Bach in his own home, in his pajamas, in the morning, on his own piano without a noisy audience present. Why not just record him at home and get a perfect performance. He made a good point, but was he missing something?</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> I love to play for audiences. I have to practice, but it’s boring. I really <em>love</em> being on stage, being able to be in the moment. I always play a bit differently. I love the spontaneity. I love how a day feels different, how the audience feels different. A CD will never be like a live performance. I don’t want to play flawlessly, be perfect. What is perfect anyway? That’s a horrible thing. You shouldn’t want to be perfect. I like to play without a safety net. Be out there. Things happen, but all in all, it’s so much truer. This is the kind of musician I want to be. Nothing can compare to the joy you feel during or after a great concert.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> I watched you playing a tune in an empty, darkened room on the<em> New York Times </em> “In Performance” series. This is a remarkable aperture into your artistry. You exhibit such a commitment and surrender to the piece. You palpably sink into the music and go from melancholy to sorrow to grief. A huge amount happens in a scant two minutes. It’s uncanny.</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> Oh, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> Is this what you sound like without an audience, applause, orchestra, conductor—the trappings of a concert performance?</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> That’s just me being me. Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve always loved playing tunes. I don’t care about crazy technique. Of course, you have to be able to do that, too, but the most difficult thing to play is a simple tune and have the audience feel that you’re <em>in</em> it. When you’re outside it, it’s only the instrument playing. It’s not from here, inside. Beautiful sound is great, but play a melody that comes from <em>here</em>. That’s what makes me happy. That’s what I love the most.</p>
<p>I remember when I wasn’t playing for several months. I was so tired. I was way down there. It wasn’t that I was tired of playing. I just needed to be away. There were other things I had to focus on and I just couldn’t play in the same way. I went to a concert with a good friend of mine, a great jazz trumpeter in Norway. I heard &#8220;Youkali&#8221; by Kurt Weill, which I’ve played a lot on the trumpet, and I started crying like a crazy person. From that moment, I understood exactly what I longed for the most. After two months away, I longed to play something I mean. I longed to just play that melody and have how that felt inside of me. It’s deeper than “I need to express myself.” A lot of people say that. It’s much deeper than that. I started crying because I missed it so much, because it’s one of the things I need to exist. That’s the <em>one</em> thing I need and love the most about playing, that’s what keeps me going, that feeling I get alone or in front of people.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> I watched another video of you playing &#8220;My Little Country&#8221; on the roof of Oslo’s City Hall at a memorial concert one year after the horrific killings in Oslo in 2011. I cannot fathom how you played so movingly with gusts of wind swirling and sea gulls flying over your head.</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> This tune I played had already become a comfort for the people from the very beginning. Others had also performed it. They wanted me to open the program by standing on the roof. I had inner ear monitoring, so in one sense I felt that I wasn’t on the roof because I could hear the orchestra down below in my ear. The wind was blowing like crazy. It wasn’t like that in rehearsal, and it was almost dangerous. I opened my mouth and got so much air, I didn’t have to breathe in. It was very emotional. I also played three days after the attack. There were tens of thousands of people in the street. When I started to play, everyone was raising their roses in the air. I felt outside of myself.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> Your voice gave their sorrow voice.</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> That’s what I want music to do. I played at the service in the church near where it happened, too. That was what I could contribute.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> You have said this about your instrument: “My trumpets are like my best friends. I miss them if I don’t have them around, and I get very moody if I don’t play on them. It’s very special, but they are one of the things I feel closest to.” That’s a passionate statement, to be fully alive, connected, feeling, expressive. Do you ever get to the point where you want to live without music, to put the trumpets back in their case and turn off—or turn down—the music playing in your head?</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> Yes, definitely. I need that. You have to experience life; otherwise there is nothing to share. Take days off, go to concerts, a soccer game, the movies, do something totally different, travel somewhere without the instrument. I try to take a holiday, be there with my boyfriend, who also plays the trumpet. We’re going to Scotland and not doing anything related to music. We’re going to play golf and visit a whiskey distillery. I like to see how things are made. It’s also art. I like to go to exhibitions, see athletes in action. I like to see how things work; I like to go underneath the glamour.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> You give 100<span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span>120 concerts each year all over the world. How do you make the rigors of touring work for you, so you are not counting the days until you are home?</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> I’ve been in the States for almost one month now, and that’s a long time, so I’m really looking forward to getting home to my apartment and sleeping in my own bed and having my wonderful view of the ocean out of my window.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I liked to think that I was privileged to tour. So many people would want this life. I don’t think like that so much anymore. I am extremely grateful for the life I have. I can actually earn money doing the thing I love the most, the thing that makes me feel so alive, so good. But I’m also allowed to be tired. I’m also not always wanting to go. I’m allowed to have all these feelings.</p>
<p>I have these abilities. How I got them? I don’t know. I was born with them.</p>
<p>Before, I liked to think that it was my responsibility to do this—and maybe somehow it is. At the same time, I’m doing it because it’s the time when I feel closest to myself, and that helps me to get in touch with my emotions in a different way. It makes me be a more honest person. It’s not my responsibility to show this to people. It’s my choice to do so. On the other hand, it feels like I don’t have a choice, because it’s what makes me me. It’s a very strange thing [<em>laughs</em>].</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> As I see it, you were a child prodigy, already performing as a soloist at ten. Your gift put you on a path to greatness from a very young age.</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> It’s never been an option for me to do this. <em>Never</em>. I feel like I have to do this. My inner drive tells me to do it, but not because someone else tells me to perform because I have this special gift. I want and <em>need</em> to do this. It’s my choice.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> You’ll be back in the States in October to perform in Philadelphia, and in December you’ll be in Cincinnati. On February 3, 2018, you’ll be playing two great concertos at Carnegie Hall: the Bach/Vivaldi and the Albinoni. Both have world-famous adagios. How do you access the emotions of an adagio? The choreographer, George Balanchine, used to say, “Suffer” and you’ll go deep. Some musicians insist that if you play a piece with absolute virtuosity, the composer will provide the profundity. It’s all in the notes.</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> It’s a bit of both. First of all, you need to master your instrument in the best possible way. You need all the tools to express what you want to express. Think about your breathing, all the technical aspects; learn all you can. In that way, you need to be a virtuoso. But these two things, learning your instrument and starting to play music, should not be separated. From when I started, basically, when I was a little girl, there was something special about my sound, my way of phrasing. I loved exploring that.</p>
<p>When you play an adagio, you need to really be true to yourself, your emotions, be true, and then be able to let go in it. When I’m in it, I don’t think about it. I just do it. It happens automatically, because I’ve done all my work. You use all your tools; but, at the same time, you have to be <em>completely</em> in it, vulnerable, completely naked. Do not be full of ego because that will never work. That keeps you on the surface. Be in the middle of everything, listen to what the musicians you play with are doing, listen to the audience. Be in that moment which is so rare, so special. Be the center of attention.</p>
<p>Someone told me very early on, “When you come on stage, without doing anything, you have everyone’s attention.” I’ve never worked on this. I’ve always had that. It’s a great feeling. I can hear the audience listening. They want to hear what I have to say, and then I’m undressing myself somehow—my <em>feelings</em>. This is me. This is what I have to say. You can’t learn to do that.</p>
<p>Of course, I wear nice dresses, and I have my makeup on, because it makes me feel in the zone, but I could also come in my everyday clothes, no makeup, no anything.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> When you were nineteen, you recorded the classical trumpet standards by Haydn, Neruda, Albinoni, and Hummel to great acclaim. That’s a daunting assignment for such a young person.</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> People said to me, “Oh, my god, that’s insane. Why would you do that? You’re too young.” My producer at the record label said that I already had something to say, so let’s do it. Again, I’m not striving for perfection. That doesn’t exist. I’m really connected to this music. The only thing that felt right, that felt real, was to record these pieces first. This was what I had to do. In ten years, maybe I’ll record this music again, with the same or a different orchestra or even in a live performance. I’ll sound different. I’ve developed. I’ve <em>extremely</em> developed. I don’t play the same anymore. It’s life. You’re very different at thirty from when you were nineteen. You’re at a very different place, but it’ll always be about being open and vulnerable. Then again, it’s my safe place.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> You also play jazz trumpet with TTHQ, Tine Thing Helseth Quintet, and you sing. People are totally surprised to hear your singing voice. It doesn’t sound like your trumpet voice or your speaking voice.</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> I’ve always been singing since I was a young girl. I sang in a choir but not so much publicly. Now I’m writing my own music, pop-jazzy songs. The lyrics are very honest.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> I’ve heard you sing Joni Mitchell’s &#8220;River.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tine Thing Helseth:</strong> I think you can hear in my own songs that I’m a little bit Joni Mitchell-inspired. I believe her, hearing her sing <em>Both Sides Now</em> and how she’s different now from when she was younger. You can really hear that she knows stuff. She’s lived.</p>
<p>It was terrifying at first to sing for an audience, but it’s a little less terrifying today, since I’ve done it a lot by now in public. I love writing my own songs. It’s extremely exciting. It’s a new side of me, but sharing with people is still a little bit terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> You transcribe so many works for the trumpet. You also commission a lot of new works, and you’ve written your own cadenzas for the trumpet. That’s a ton of work.</p>

Frick</a>.]</i> <p>In Gwadar, the first thing that struck me was the hills. The color of bone, they line the coast, hacked into straight lines as if hewed by human hands or mining. But it is harsh winds that have chiselled these sharp squares and turrets. In the local Baloch language, Gwadar means “gateway of the wind.” Below the hills, barren scrubland stretches out, a sandy moonscape under white hot sun.</p>
<p>We had just touched down at the airport, a dusty strip of tarmac serving as a runway, fronted by a blocky concrete building with a sniper positioned on top. “This will be an international hub—the biggest airport in Pakistan,” said the army official escorting us.</p>
<p>There were more than twenty of us, a delegation of journalists flown from Islamabad to Gwadar to see the outpost touted by officials as the next Dubai or Shenzhen. We filed into the waiting armored vehicles, discombobulated after a bumpy three-hour ride on a military jet, strapped in like extras in a war movie.</p>
<p>Glistening aquamarine sea stretched out on one side of the twisting road to the hotel, the colors saturated in the heavy sun. Traditional fishing boats, dhows, bobbed in the distance. Some half-built boats stood on the beach, turned vertical. Sudden bursts of life punctuated the long stretches of unpopulated land. Children and wiry teenagers in graying white vests, splashing water on their arms from shallow rock pools. A group of different-colored goats, leaping over the uneven surface of the beach, hair shining damp from sea spray. A man sitting in a cart pulled by a donkey, beneath a propped-up dhow.</p>
<p>As we turned, the beach gave way to sparse scrubland, the angular hills looming in the distance. The occasional hollowed-out brick structure served as a shop, the blue and red of the Pepsi logo daubed on its side, men in traditional clothing outside on stools. As we approached the hotel, signs of activity became less frequent, and then nonexistent. This was a sensitive area, close to the paramilitary Frontier Corps’ base and the site of the town’s only five-star hotel.</p>
<p>The Pearl Continental is perched at the edge of a precipice, atop a hill that looks as if it could disintegrate in heavy rain. The hotel is a boxy structure, all squares and oblongs like the hills surrounding it. This alien fortress on its perilous earthy mound looks down at the army base immediately below and at Gwadar town, an impoverished fishing settlement some miles away.</p>
<p>If Pakistan and China’s plans work out, this will be the unlikely epicenter of the new world order.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>here is a saying in Balochistan that every good tribesman should memorize thirty <em>she’er</em>, or verses, describing legends and transmit them to his sons. This way, the oral tradition lives on. In the modern era, poets have written down their compositions, rekindling ethnic Baloch fervor and chronicling continued revolt against colonizers with designs on this sprawling expanse of craggy mountains and barren desert. The largest and least populated of Pakistan’s four main provinces (making up 44 percent of the country’s land mass but 5 percent of the population), Balochistan is politically marginalized, extremely underdeveloped, and home to a low level but long-running separatist insurgency. Though today’s insurgents are splintered, they share a historic set of grievances: that Balochistan is being exploited by outsiders, leaving locals without a fair share of the region’s resources.</p>
<p>Gwadar is a remote coastal outpost in Balochistan, just eighty kilometers from the Iran border. Swathes of uninhabitable land swell between the cities and towns, making the distances hard to cross but providing ample space for insurgents and bandits to hide. While Gwadar has changed official hands several times—it was an overseas protectorate of Oman throughout British rule in India, and then, after independence, was incorporated into Pakistan—tribal loyalties have long been more important than the writ of the state. The people of Gwadar, like the people of Chabahar over the border in Iran, consider themselves first and foremost Baloch. What matters is the land. The word &#8220;<em>mitti</em>&#8220;—mud, soil, earth, land—carries huge significance. “<em>Apni mitti</em>” is more than simply “our land,” or “my land.” It refers to roots and identity, a sense of loyalty, faith, ownership, and worship, all of which provoke a passion that can demand any sacrifice—including one’s life. You belong to it and it belongs to you.</p>
<div class="asterisks">* * *</div>
<p>Dressed in his army fatigues and regulation beret, Lieutenant General Amir Riaz, commander of the Southern Command, a corps of the Pakistani Army, took the stage to enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>“We are all sitting in Gwadar together, which, a few years ago, would not have been possible,” he said, as the claps died down. “It will grow, and continue to grow.”</p>
<p>We were in Pearl Continental’s conference suite, a large hall with dark-red carpets and rows and rows of velvet covered chairs, in the midst of a “seminar” on China and Pakistan’s plans to develop Gwadar’s port. Journalists, businessmen, and local residents had congregated to ask questions of the civilian politicians, Chinese officials, and military leaders pushing the project forward.</p>
<p>The Pakistani state, highly sensitive about Balochistan and in particular about its treasured cooperation with China, typically tightly restricts media access to the region. But this time, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had organized the press trip themselves, keen to display the open discussion to our delegation of mostly Pakistani journalists. This was part of a public-relations push, to show the nation—and the world—that Gwadar was soon to be open for business, and that all doubts about development there could be cast aside. They envisage a modern city, free from insurgency and full of luxurious hotels and shopping malls, with a major international airport and a range of secondary industries springing up around the port.</p>
<p>Our movements were tightly planned: the occasional authorized and closely supervised trip out of the hotel, and then back to the dazzling white of the Pearl Continental’s lobby. The hotel staff, unaccustomed to so much activity, rushed around manically as the reception filled with military top brass, an array of journalists and businessmen, and a steadily expanding contingent of residents. The rooms were imposing, with marbled bathrooms and sumptuous beds, large windows looking out onto the wasteland below, like a portal to another dimension. Those above the second floor had never been used before, and the only Chinese journalist attending saw a mouse scuttle across his floor, momentarily puncturing the grandeur.</p>
<p>On stage in the conference hall, Riaz was warming to his task. “The world opens here,” he proclaimed. “Gwadar will be a place of consequence.”</p>
<p>There were big cheers, but not everyone in the room agreed. When the question-and-answer session began, the criticisms came thick and fast. Would locals benefit from the development? What about the claim that the Chinese wanted to build a wall around Gwadar, to keep it separate from the rest of Balochistan province?</p>
<p>“Gwadar should be secure,” said Riaz, smiling. “But I can absolutely deny that we have had any request for a wall from anyone from China.”</p>
<p>A businessman raised his hand. “We have been colonized before,” he said, standing up to ensure he was heard. “We do not want to be colonized again.”</p>
<p>“Let me tell you,” said Riaz, his voice rising. “The <em>Angrez</em> [English] have gone. This. Is. Your. Country.” The room erupted in cheers.</p>
<div class="asterisks">* * *</div>
<p>For centuries, Gwadar was a small, unremarkable settlement with an economy based on artisanal fishing. But in 1954, a few years before it was purchased from Oman by Pakistan, the United States Geological Survey identified Gwadar as a suitable site for a deep-water port. Deep-water ports are geopolitically important because their depth allows them to accommodate larger ships with heavier loads. Gwadar has the extra boon of being a warm-water port, meaning it doesn’t freeze over in winter. The Russians set their sights on Gwadar in the 1970s during the occupation of Afghanistan, but their vision did not come to fruition. It took three more decades and another superpower before serious steps were taken to develop Gwadar into a major port.</p>
<p>In 2001, soon after 9/11, construction on the first phase of Gwadar Port began. The project was driven forward by the military dictator Pervez Musharraf, and China was the majority funder. Gwadar had a population of just five thousand when the building began. But soon, this remote, impoverished fishing village was being touted as the new Dubai or Singapore. Never mind the spreading insurgency or the local resentments. After the construction workers arrived, so did the property speculators. Tribesmen sold off ancestral land at vastly inflated sums; some willingly, others under pressure. On this rocky land, businessmen and developers imagined luxury apartment blocks and five-star hotels. Amid the buying frenzy, the bubble inflated and stretched and in 2006—a year before the port was complete—it burst. Developers lost money, but locals lost their land: <em>mitti</em> sold off in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p>All the while, construction of the port went on. It was inaugurated in 2007 by Musharraf and the Chinese minister for communication, Li Shen. Musharraf gave a speech paying tribute to the friendship between China and Pakistan. This new seaport would, he said, open a major trade corridor from Pakistan, not just to China, but to Central Asia and Turkmenistan. He warned that Balochistan’s “extremist elements” must surrender their weapons or be “wiped out of this area.” Pakistani officials said that within a few years, Gwadar would be among the world’s biggest, best, and busiest seaports.</p>
<p>When I visited in April 2016, the port stood empty, its sharp lines and clean, freshly paved ground a striking contrast to the barren and rocky terrain beyond.</p>
<div class="asterisks">* * *</div>
<p>It is expensive to start a big infrastructure project, let alone one that is targeted by an insurgency, and for years investment was lacking. The funding situation, at least, changed in April 2015. Eight years after the port was completed, Pakistan and China announced a new plan: the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This forty-six-billion-dollar scheme aims to link northern Pakistan and western China to the deep-water seaport at Gwadar through a 3,200-kilometer network of railways and roads stretching across Pakistan. The Karakoram Highway in northern Pakistan is undergoing expensive repair work to make it functional across seasons (at present, it is not unusual for rain or snow to halt journeys altogether). A new coastal highway connecting Gwadar to Karachi, 470 kilometers away, has been completed, reducing the journey time from forty-eight hours to seven. Gwadar is situated where the Arabian Sea meets the Persian Gulf, just outside the Straits of Hormuz and close to key shipping routes. Around 60 percent of China’s oil comes from the Persian Gulf via ships which travel over sixteen thousand kilometers to Shanghai. Gwadar’s port could reduce the distance to five thousand kilometers.</p>
<p>Today, the population of Gwadar has expanded to somewhere between eighty thousand and 125,000. The area is now subject to strict security, with a heavy Pakistani Army presence. On our visit, soldiers in army fatigues stood guard near the water’s edge, looking outwards but also keeping a close eye on journalists straying too close to the military ships. The Pakistani guards inside the development had rifles slung over their shoulders. Their black t-shirts flaunted “No Fear” in gaudy white bubble writing.</p>
<p>This is one small part of China’s ambitious One Belt, One Road initiative that aims to build cooperation and connectivity between China and Eurasia. If China succeeds in establishing its new Silk Road, it will have achieved in a few years what Russia failed to do in centuries. In November 2016, some months after my visit, the first shipment of goods from China left Gwadar for Africa and the Middle East, making the port formally operational. A collection of Pakistani and Chinese officials gathered to wave it off. “Today marks the dawn of a new era,” said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. But there’s been limited activity since. And officials say the port will not be “fully operational” until 2030.</p>
<p>Politics in South Asia are often driven by competition and the fear of encirclement. India, afraid of being surrounded by China, has moved to establish its own trade route to Central Asia, with a deep-water port at nearby Chabahar in Iran, and an equally ambitious road and rail route going through Afghanistan. There is speculation that China’s true aims in Gwadar are not economic but naval, and that the port at Gwadar is a cover for Beijing to keep an eye on Indian and American naval activity in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>While these geopolitical wranglings continue, Gwadar is about to see radical change. In addition to the main CPEC project, the China Overseas Port Holding Company has just begun construction on the two-billion-dollar Gwadar Special Economic Zone, modeled on China’s Special Economic Zones, areas which manage their economies in ways designed to attract outside investors. Officials predict that the population will swell again, to two million people, including twenty thousand Chinese workers. With them will come development and jobs. If all goes according to plan, Gwadar will no longer be a remote outpost in a remote province, but a central point of transfer between Pakistan and global markets, a place where journeys begin and end. Theoretically, two remote places will be transformed. The marginalized and restive western Chinese province of Xinjiang will be connected, overland, to Gwadar, which in turn will act as a portal to the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Officials and developers envision this desolate, dramatic landscape transformed and tamed. Yet Gwadar suffers such intense poverty and water shortages that a recent spate of robberies targeted bottled water. As residents of China’s Special Economic Zones would attest, top-down development often exacerbates economic inequality. The dream is to build an international trade hub and glamorous destination on top of underdeveloped scrubland. But scrubland to an outsider is <em>mitti</em> to inhabitants who have raised generations on this soil—and their place in the new story of Gwadar is as yet uncertain.</p>

<em> Our poems are composed for our heroes?</em><br />

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>alochistan’s great twentieth-century poets all deal with themes of rebellion, anti-imperialism, and Baloch heroism in the face of exploitation. Their words, which built upon the rich oral history of this primarily tribal and illiterate society, give great insight into the Baloch mentality. Many of their poems, railing against oppression from other Pakistanis and foreigners, could have been written today.</p>
<p>Ever since Pakistan was formed in 1947, Balochistan’s alienation from the state has been a constant. A year after Partition, in 1948, the military forcibly annexed Kalat, in south Balochistan, after a pro-independence uprising, setting the tone for the continued militarization of the province. In the intervening years, Baloch alienation has sporadically led to rebellion, including a full-scale insurgency in the 1970s. In between, low-level resistance has rumbled on. This is a society that has always been made up of small polities, and today there are over 140 Baloch tribes. This means that Baloch nationalists—who come from different tribes and have different priorities—do not speak with one voice. Some are full-blown separatists, demanding a new independent state. Some simply want more rights within a federal Pakistan. While no Baloch rebellion has extended to the entire province, or even mobilized more than a handful of tribes, mistrust of the existing political order is widespread.</p>
<p>A key grievance is that Balochistan’s rich resources—coal, natural gas, and perhaps even petroleum—are exploited by central government. Federal money is divided between Pakistan’s provinces according to a strict calculation based on population size, which privileges the densely populated and already wealthy Punjab and disadvantages Balochistan. This historic resentment has led to the murders of so-called “settlers,” Punjabis who have often lived in Balochistan for generations. According to human-rights groups, more than one thousand of these non-Baloch citizens have been murdered since 2006.</p>
<p>This fury about the <em>mitti</em>—the soil, honor, and lifeblood—being abused by outsiders is compounded by the fact that the Baloch might already be a minority in their own province. At least a quarter of Pakistani Baloch live elsewhere in the country. (Karachi, in neighbouring Sindh province, is the center of Baloch nationalism.) Continued conflict in Afghanistan has bolstered an already sizable Pashtun population, and this inexorable increase in immigration—refugees on one side and economic interlopers on the others—plays to historic fears of being outnumbered and diluted.</p>
<p>In between speeches in the conference hall, I sat with Abdul Malik Baloch, chief minister of Balochistan from 2013 to 2015 and a former president of the National Party. We drank watery instant coffee in the bustling dining area of the Pearl Continental as other delegates walked past, taking selfies and comparing notes.</p>
<p>“Generally CPEC is a good thing, but we Baloch are very sensitive about our identity,” he told me. “It is a big area and a small population. We are appreciative of every investment but cautious about being taken over. They have to let us benefit from the development. The benefits should go to every last fisherman, not only to the neoliberal economists.” He paused, taking a sip of his coffee. “If not? We resist.”</p>
<div class="asterisks">* * *</div>
<p>Suddenly, an enormous octopus was projected onto the screen in the conference room, large lettering at the end of its tentacles reading “NATIONALISM” and “SUBNATIONALISM.”</p>
<p>“We need to know what we are up against,” said the army official. “Lack of integration is the cause of internal disturbances in Balochistan. These grievances have been exploited by subnationalists. Today things are much better. Balochistan is all set to exploit its full potential!”</p>
<p>The octopus remained, gormlessly and inexplicably beamed up onto the screen, as the official explained that through nationalism—promoting the love of Pakistan and a singular Pakistani identity for everyone—subnationalism could be defeated. Subnationalism, he explained, was a destructive force, selling the fictitious idea that people should identify more strongly as Baloch than as Pakistani. “The subnationalist narrative blames Punjab for deprivation and illiteracy,” he said. “Subnationalist actors abroad are involved in the exploitation of the common man, using him as fodder while enjoying affluent lives abroad.”</p>
<p>The octopus disappeared to make way for a video clip of a huge Independence Day event held at a stadium in Quetta, the provincial capital. “It was a conflict zone, but now things are much improved,” said a smiling woman in a colorful hijab.</p>
<p>“We have a slogan,” the official continued. “It is, ‘Long live Balochistan, long live Pakistan!’ This has taken the wind out of the sails of the subnationalists.”</p>
<p>He clicked onto the next slide, a circular chart detailing the military strategy in Balochistan. It was a crudely drawn dial under the title “People Centric Approach,” with a caption below reading, “Love Begets Love.” There were seven points on the dial. The first six all read, “Love,” in green lettering. The final point was in red. It read, “Selective Use Of Force.”</p>
<p>“We have the selective use of force because some people are not ready to lay down their arms,” the official was saying, before quickly reeling off a list of separatist activists who have been killed.</p>
<p>The military campaign in Balochistan has weakened the patchy and deeply divided insurgency; a tally of press reports found that separatist violence in 2015 fell by 36 percent to 194 attacks. But there is a darker side to this. Intelligence agents, often accompanied by the Frontier Corps, are accused of “disappearing” suspected militants into secret detention sites. Often, their bodies turn up dead in deserted areas bearing signs of torture. In 2015, the provincial government said that the bodies of eight hundred people linked to the insurgency had been recovered from 2011 to 2014. It estimated that 950 were still missing. In 2013, a UN fact-finding team noted claims from some in Balochistan that the number is as high as fourteen thousand.</p>
<p>He changed the slide to his finale. It read, in large letters: “DOABLE! MANAGEABLE!”</p>
<div class="asterisks">* * *</div>
<p>Pakistani officials are acutely aware that the new Gwadar development projects could spark disorder. It has happened before. After Musharraf took power in 1999, a new round of violent unrest began, partly precipitated by anxiety about government projects in the region: the initial construction of Gwadar Port and new military cantonments near an existing development, the Sui gas fields. The official line was that these bases were intended to increase ethnic Baloch recruitment into the armed forces, but to locals it looked like another effort to procure, colonize, and militarize their <em>mitti</em>.</p>
<p>The armed protest grew slowly, and gradually spread through different Baloch tribes. In this vast and barren land, inaccessible to independent observers or journalists, definitive facts are hard to come by, and the search for truth is undermined by an ongoing propaganda war between government and rebels. The details of the insurgency, even the number of active fighters, are hotly contested. One army official told me there were just a few hundred nationalist militants left; a Baloch journalist said they numbered in the thousands.</p>
<p>The unrest exploded after the rape of a female doctor by a military officer in 2004 at the Sui gas fields, in heart of the Bugti tribal area. Bugti tribesmen, led by Sardar Akbar Bugti, attacked the gas-producing plant at Sui, which provided almost half of Pakistan’s gas.</p>
<p>The Sui gas field is a flashpoint often cited by critics of the Gwadar development. It is in Balochistan, but the province has seen scant benefits. Highly paid jobs went to outsiders; the few local men working there are mostly in unskilled jobs. Most locals did not have the necessary technical education, and there was no attempt to teach them. Instead, they were sidelined. Balochistan receives significantly lower royalties than other provinces with more recently discovered gas fields.</p>
<p>In 2005, tensions ramped up. “Don’t push us,” said Musharraf. “It isn’t the 1970s, when you can hit and run and hide in the mountains. This time you won’t even know what hit you.” Other Baloch fighting tribes—the Mengals, Mazaris, and Marris— rushed to aid the Bugtis. The rebels released a list of demands, including more jobs for Baloch people, greater gas royalties from Sui, greater Baloch ownership of the then under construction Gwadar port, and no more military bases in the province. They were refused. Despite Musharraf’s scathing words, Sardar Akbar Bugti and his men did indeed take to the hills, hiding in a cave 150 miles east of Quetta. Bugti was killed by the army in 2006.</p>
<p>The death of this figurehead prompted many more heads to spring up, Hydra-like, from the severed neck. Most military men now agree the execution of Bugti was a disaster which greatly expanded support for the rebels, particularly the more extreme factions. An all-out insurgency followed Bugti’s death, and over one thousand people—rebels, police, soldiers—died.</p>
<p>And the war over information continues. Pakistani and Western intelligence sources agree that the Baloch insurgency is at least partly funded by India; even the rebellion for this contested land might involve some outside hand. The Pakistani government and military are intensely sensitive to criticism of their actions in Balochistan. Critical foreign journalists have had their visas revoked.</p>
<p>One evening, we drove to a local beauty spot, a cliff overlooking the ocean nicknamed “Sunset Point.” The earth here, atop the angular hills, was brown, a richer hue than the gray dust that seemed to cover everything below. Rows of chairs and sofas had been set out. Servants hurriedly served up hot samosas and large containers of tea on fold-out tables. I walked away from the surreal open-air tea party to speak to a Baloch journalist from Quetta.</p>
<p>“What do local people really think about the Gwadar port?” I asked.</p>
<p>He laughed and looked nervously around, pressing his business card into my hand. “I—we—think a lot of things. Let’s talk another time.”</p>
<p>A man, dressed in a conspicuously casual polo shirt and sunglasses, immediately wandered over. “Everything okay? Are you enjoying the sunset? Can I take your photograph?” He held up an iPhone and gestured for me to stand and pose.</p>
<p>Confused, I smiled for a photo. The man then stood by my side and took a series of selfies. I let this interloper put the iPhone away before introducing myself and asking what he did.</p>
<p>He looked, shiftily, from side to side. “That doesn’t matter. Think of me as the photographer.”</p>
<p>The journalist, by this time, had walked away and was standing alone, looking out to the sunset. The man looked after him, making sure he wasn’t coming back, and then made his excuses to me and melted back into the crowd.</p>
<div class="asterisks">* * *</div>
<p>The big event during my time in Gwadar was the arrival of General Raheel Sharif, then the chief of army staff and the most powerful man in the country. Pakistan’s military has run the country for more than half of its history. It’s not technically in charge at the moment, but in practice, it holds the reins of power. The federal government was noticeably absent, despite the potential for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project to change the narrative on Pakistan from almost-failed state to major regional player. Heavy army involvement in CPEC is understood as another sign of military dominance in Pakistan’s eternal civilian-military tussle, but it is also undeniable that the state usually leaves the Army to deal with this troublesome region.</p>
<p>The first sign that Sharif was on his way was the lack of phone signal—provincial authorities across Pakistan often shut down mobile-phone networks at the first hint of unrest or bomb threats. To be absolutely sure, the hotel switched off the wifi, too. The remoteness of our location was cemented by the sudden digital lockdown.</p>
<p>People crowded into the conference hall. The atmosphere was heady, angry, and tense: local people brought face to face with those proposing a radical change to their home. The disjunction between the Gwadar conjured up by officials and the present reality became difficult to avoid, as talk of the deep-water port gave way to more pressing anxieties. “People from Gwadar care about getting water,” said Mir Hammal Kalmati, member of the Provincial Assembly for Gwadar in Urdu, shouting to be heard over the applause. “Without this, we will die. We cannot make anything without water. We have no schools, no water, no help. We will welcome CPEC if it can do this work.” During a break, I noticed some local residents eagerly taking the bottles of water offered by staff, stashing them for later.</p>
<p>Sharif and his army entourage arrived in the afternoon, several hours late, swanning through the lobby like film stars on the red carpet. They sat down in the front row. The chief minister of Balochistan, Sanaullah Zehri, a portly tribal politician affiliated with the party of central government, took the stage. He commended the efforts of law-enforcement agencies in bringing kidnappings and murders under control. In the presence of Sharif, the most honored guest, the officials doubled down on their descriptions of Gwadar’s future greatness. But the presence of the people who would be most affected cracked the visage.</p>
<p>Balochistan is deeply conservative and patriarchal, and local girls from Gwadar sat separately from the men. During the question-and-answer session, three girls, not older than fifteen, stood up and walked deliberately from their spot at the back of the room right to the front. They stood facing the stage, their backs to Sharif and the other military men in the audience. Two wore headscarves, the third a full face veil. They explained that they were students.</p>
<p>“We are focusing on the port, but what about our water shortages?” said one. “A girls’ college was promised to us in 2006 and it has not been built. We hear about this port but development for the people is not happening.”</p>
<p>The chief minister laughed, appearing taken aback by her direct tone. “Well,” he said, as if he was speaking to a small child. “I am giving you my word that the college will be built.”</p>
<p>The girl in the face covering spoke up. “And tell me, why should we listen to you? You people get elected to high office so you can buy yourself houses and do nothing.”</p>
<p>The room was silent. Eyes turned to Sharif, who laughed and shook his head. The crowd took his cue, clapping loudly and stamping their feet.</p>

<p class="no-dropcap"><em>Come, come, oh revolution! Move with bravery.</em><br />
<em> Come, come, for life cannot go on in such wretchedness&#8230;</em><br />
<em> The fatherland is ruined by the elders and the people are lost and homeless.</em><br />
<em> The poor, the landless, and the shepherds are running in darkness.</em><br />
<em>—Gul Khan Nasir (1971, poem from </em>Grand<em>)</em></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> harsh and barren landscape is the perfect backdrop on which to project multiple dreams. There is the Pakistani state’s dream of economic transformation, trade over terrorism, access to lucrative markets, and a seat at the regional power table. There is China’s dream of forging a new Silk Road, a global trade route, and a path toward economic dominance. If Indian and American worries are to be believed, China has a second dream too, of tightening its military control across the region.</p>
<p>The dream of economic transformation is shared by at least some Baloch. Mariya, a passionate young woman from Balochistan’s tribal areas, is dedicated to promoting CPEC. Standing at the port, she gesticulated enthusiastically as she explained the great benefits it could bring to her home: a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for her people to be part of the country’s economic future. Even Abdul Malik Baloch, the former nationalist leader, expressed grudging support for the plan, if proper steps are taken to protect Baloch interests.</p>
<p>Yet the incongruities are concrete, and hard to escape. “This is the safest place, not just in Pakistan, but in the world,” Zhang Baozhong, chairman of the China Overseas Ports Holding Company, declared at the seminar. I thought of that as I watched trucks full of police and soldiers close off roads so that our rag-tag group of journalists and researchers could drive through. For the police, this is normal procedure when Chinese officials come to town. In 2004, a car bomb in Gwadar killed three Chinese engineers. More recently, in 2016, two Pakistani coastguards were killed, and in May 2017, gunmen from the Baloch Liberation Army—an armed separatist group—opened fire on construction workers, killing ten.</p>
<p>The poverty in Gwadar is palpable. You can see it in the rundown shops at the side of the road, smell it in the odor of sewage that wafts in through the windows of the armored vehicles foreigners travel in. If the port development could ease poverty, bring revenue and jobs and desperately needed water and electricity to Gwadar, is it such a bad thing?</p>
<p>Perhaps not, but any rapid change of an area, particularly change imposed from the top down, is experienced as a form of structural violence by local inhabitants, no matter what the economic gain might be. Here, there is no guarantee that the intensely poor residents who have made their living for generations as fishermen will be fellow travelers on the journey ordained for Gwadar. The dreams of officials sound surreal, even fantastical. “A five-star hotel will be built here,” they say, on nondescript stretches of barren land. “All this will be unrecognizable.” But that is precisely what the Baloch fear.</p>
<p>One evening, staff at the Pearl Continental set up a meal on the roof terrace. A small water feature ran dry. The tables were set, but food had not yet been served. I walked to the edge of the terrace and looked out at Gwadar town. The electricity was out; there were barely any lights. The hum of the hotel’s generator, powering air conditioners in every room, filled my ears.</p>
<p>At the port, the authorities had laid out a red carpet for us, the visitors. Tacked up on the makeshift display was a map of the planned expansion of the port complex. It depicted a new harbor, forty kilometers away from where fishermen have been based for many years. This was for good reason. The port complex extended right over the area currently known as Gwadar town.</p>

I’d close my eyes: I was both inside and outside the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With his jutting cheekbones and long thin frame, his voice and movements giving him an effeminate air, Istepan would observe the effect on me of the broken melodies emanating from his cheap oud. The shrimpmonger would have just come in from the street. Sturdy, with bristly hands and broad shoulders, his face covered in hard lines, the length of him covered in a large-pocketed jerkin, his black hair constantly wet with rain, he’d come around filling my tiny rakı glass. His wife was a very dark-skinned woman. I could see she was pleased to entertain me, but eventually something in her eyes made me suspect she might feel sorry for me. Squinting and winking, narrowing and bulging out her eyes, she’d accompany Istepan by swinging her head along with the song he was singing—the one that starts, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">O tamehasis toteta mezitisis.” </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the objects in the room, the smell of charcoal and cloves, drew up close to me as the number of glasses increased; it was as if they were all telling me that the one by my side, the one whose face I wasn’t looking at, the one who had been waiting for me in this room on that winter night in a poor and desolate but loving state—it was as if they were telling me that even though the shrimpmonger had shouldered their expense, they also loved me for being a good tenant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment when everything</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">drew close and said, “Our tenant! Our sweet tenant,” without my getting used to the objects around me, I couldn’t get comfortable. Nothing could make the shrimpmonger’s house more beautiful, not Istepan singing the Greek song “You’ll Look for Me When You Lose Me” in Turkish, nor his melancholic humanity, nor the shrimpmonger’s deep booming voice that filled the room, not even Sofiya’s ample, flawless brown legs now resting under the table. I’d turn around and look:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There she is—my beloved. Still in the pullover they’d call a chemise, its color a sweet red they’d call cyclamen, and the voices around us would cut out. Everything stopped, as if all the Sofiyas and Istepans and shrimpmongers had gone away, and we were daydreaming that we were alone with only the smell of burned cloves in the room. I would be in love. I would say:</span></p>
<p>“Brought from my lover’s lips.”</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me,” she’d say, “don’t look at me like that!”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d drink another glass of rakı. On my back, I’d feel the drip-drop of a cold raindrop on a tin roof nearby. I’d follow that raindrop wherever it might go. The raindrop that</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lands</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by a cat left on the street or on a bare-legged wretch, or a white neck, or a strand of curly hair . . . outside that heated and well-lit room lined with bookshelves, by the side of some beautiful face . . .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sadness took hold of me. This raindrop where abjection, wealth, despair, satisfaction, solitude, the thousand things attached to human life mixed together, was just outside. I was seized by the desire to raise the tightly drawn curtain, open the window, and let that drop fall into my rakı. I’d fill my glass with all the yearning, poverty, satisfaction, all the jewels of human life’s happiness and misery contained in that raindrop, add to the glass a dash of the fleeting, fleeing taste of my lover’s brown face, then take it down in one gulp:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Istepan,” I’d cry out. “Play me an old song!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Istepan, thinking of the two lira I was going to give him, or wondering somewhere</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">behind his white and innocent forehead whether or not I’d give him, his eyes set on some undetermined point in my face, would play outmoded songs by some bad songwriter who’d just turned forty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, I’d met up with one of my lover’s friends. In one of the small rooms in her house, the rains still falling on some zinc roof. Lying on a low divan, listening to the thrum of rain, with the girl’s blond hair falling over my chest, I found myself saying:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yorgiya, my dear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl shot up like a dart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s hopeless. There’s no way you can forget about her. From now on every woman is her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to put into these stories whatever my memory stirs up, writing whatever comes into my mind without trying to give it any coherence, it seems I’ve lost track of the shrimpmonger’s house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again I see myself going in there one Wednesday evening with my arms full of packages. A light mist of snow falling. The lights of Beyo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ğ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lu had come on just a moment before. I was as content as a grocer decently returning home in the evening, the wallet in his pocket full, his wife waiting at home, business in his shop running like clockwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand why such people are unable to see into things, into the truth of things. Annoyed, as if it were a great act of charity, I pull out my wallet and give ten kuru</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ş</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a beggar. As if I’d already paid back my entire debt to others, to humanity. Now I’ll go to some house with these packages, a door will be opened, and I can embrace a woman and lock the door behind me. I can throw back a glass, then another. After that, thinking of the warmth of my bed, I’ll eat a little pastrami, a forkful of sauerkraut. I’ll throw back one glass after another, light a cigarette, and say:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My dear wife, you’re in my days, my nights, my dreams, my cigarettes, my rakı—you’re in my blood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if I’ll be able to find the shrimpmonger’s house without thinking how much more content I’m going to be than I would be by giving ten kuru</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ş</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a kid on the street, shivering in the snow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s still too early: she won’t be here yet. How hard it is to wait for her! I better walk the streets of the neighborhood a little more . . . And this happiness I feel doesn’t even come from giving ten kuru</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ş</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a person growing cold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since people degrade the world into this form.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since twenty-year-old girls learn to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">scrounge off guys they don’t love . . . Since . . . </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m wandering into the mire. Drifting away in this foul, cadaverous world, away from the bought-off shrimpmonger, from his house, his bed, from Istepan, even from the dark, narrow face of my beloved, where the most the primitive lights of natural law, blood, soul, and thoughtlessness shine—calling out, calling out and drifting away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drifting away but to where? I might end up in some cinema, some cinema that displays crowds of beautiful guys, or maybe in the one place where everything is peaceful, noble, splendid, the most decent place a man can find in the world, the tavern. As if hypocrites weren’t twice as hypocritical there, the indecent even more indecent . . .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no escape. Better we count the shrimpmonger’s house as a tavern. An intimate tavern for three . . . Beloved faces, if they were only scoured clean of hypocrisy! If Istepan would only get to his feet:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My friend. I’d have come even it weren’t for your two glasses of rakı, your two lira. I’ve grown accustomed to you. Tonight I’ll play my songs for free.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he’d said that it would do me in. When the money flowed, there was one name Istepan was always going back to. He’d ask his wife: “Ah my Sofiya, what if Katina were here? What if I called her over?” With his two-year-old son in the house, dressed like a girl, with the world turning the way it does; if he would ever talk exactly as I’d want him to, the way I’d have him talk, it would shock me completely. No! Better Istepan says nothing at all! Better he looks at some unknown point in my face and sets his mind on my two lira! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Istepan sometimes says to this Katina, whom he loves with a girlfriend’s jealousy:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I didn’t have kids I wouldn’t be able to put up with it. My Sofiya!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Katina didn’t cheat on Istepan, who would?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At some point one of Koço the shrimpmonger’s three kids would wander into the room. I’d start trying to analyze what these three kids felt toward me and my lover. If I were their age, if I were one of the shrimpmonger’s kids, I’d understand the feelings of this man with the big pale eyes sitting across from me, of this girl with the thin brown face, wide shoulders, the damp, straw-colored neck. I’d understand from their gazes, the way they sat, their movements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesdays, this man comes with packages in his hands and bottles of rakı. On other days with other packages. In a strange silence, he enters this room that’s only able to produce whispers and thin whistling voices. He creates a passionate, peaceful universe. Our mom and dad also blend into this universe. Let the others think whatever they want about me, the children don’t think like them. The curly-haired youngest of the shrimpmonger’s kids looking from the apples and pistachios to the salted almonds, with his beautiful curly hair, looking out from his mother’s skirt as she puts pastrami in his mouth, would also plunge beneath my lover’s long eyebrows into her coffee-colored eyes. He’d sing folk songs through his tiny, stuffed-up nose. He was four. After eating all the almonds, after chewing up the pastrami, he’d look in some Freudian way at Yorgiya, then at me, then back at Yorgiya. He’d grab his mother’s hand, ask for water. She’d give him water from a rakı glass. Some days I liked to watch how greedily, with what relish he sucked down that alcohol-laced, anise-scented water. I always loved the shrimpmonger’s youngest child. There was something alive and hectic in his moods that I relished, that fed off human desire and greed, that made him want, one day, to be like this big red man sitting across from him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shrimpmonger’s other two kids were from a different mother, so they had a different position in the house than the smallest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of them was eleven years old, the other was fourteen. Both were boys. The eleven-year-old—putting up with everything, with his big, rotten eyes, his sallow face, small, ugly, with rough hands, chewed fingernails, affectionate in a way that would make you want to run away—there was nothing cute about him. But of the three children, I thought him the most good-hearted, the one that would become the most beautiful young man. He was something to see—looking people in the eye lovingly, throwing himself with a joyous velocity at the smallest chores and working with pleasure, then peacefully drawing into himself. It was like he waited all week for these Wednesday nights. Coming into the house, he’d yell:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mama, Mr. Ahmet’s here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d immediately take the packages from my hands:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you buy lemons?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d always make sure to forget the lemons. He was certain to rush to bring the can opener for the tin of sardines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boy’s servile behavior at her side would drive Sofya into nervous distraction. With some half-scolding anger—but not so she could be said to mistreat her stepchildren—she’d say:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sotiraki, baby, don’t run all around me like that. My head is spinning. Here, the nice man gave us money. Run and buy some lemons!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sotiri would say, “You need anything else, Mr. Ahmet?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d have him buy a pack of cigarettes. He’d ask, because he knew I’d give him a whole lira and let him keep the change—then he’d have seventy-five kuru</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ş</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to buy something extra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third son, fourteen-year-old Aleko, was a model of rebellion. It was like I could read his mind as he reinterpreted even the sweetest things Sofiya said to him. What a rough, frightening, rebellious creature he was. He wasn’t even afraid of his magnificent father’s large hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sofiya, always whitewashing over her evil stepmother’s soul around her other children and her husband, sanctimoniously presenting herself in the role of the good-hearted mother in front of everyone, with every gesture trying to express her blamelessness, failed only to pull it over on this kid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He abhorred her. Maybe we—Istepan, Yorgiya, me, maybe also Koço—thought Sofiya was in the right. But little Aleko would look at his stepmother with a rancorous gleam in his eyes, his small, wide-set teeth clenched together. Sofiya would say to her husband:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’ll never grow up right. Whatever I do, Koço, this kid never acts decent! It’s impossible, impossible. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demboro! Demboro!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">she’d mutter in Greek, then turn to us. “We found him a job. He ran away. He won’t work with his father. He’s started hanging out at the movie houses, the movie houses . . .” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aleko, with the toes of his shoes torn out, the skin of his thighs—crimson and chafed with filth—appearing through the holes in his tattered navy-blue shorts with their snow-white button, his hair a mess, was unapproachable—or if anyone did get close to him, we supposed they’d be driven away by the thick human stench soaked into his shirt that hadn’t been washed in months. Acting like a model child in his stepmother’s hands, waiting in front of us like a little picture of success, he’d take twenty-five kuru</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ş</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from me and run off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Yorgiya would take one last sip from her small glass and signal to Sofiya with her hand not to refill it, and first Istepan with the kids, and then the shrimpmonger, and finally Sofiya, would leave the room. The sound of the rain would start to speak, then the still-burning charcoal would speak. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and I wouldn’t speak. If I called it fear, lack of desire, or if I called it a young girl’s awful shyness, something would start in her. You couldn’t call it lack of desire exactly. She didn’t love me—that much is true—but she could feel herself about to enter the trembling, frightening universe of a man’s embrace. It gave me the sensation she’d never seen another man before me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yorgiya’s hands in mine like I was inspecting treasure—gold and silver, things formed from wealth and happiness. I’d inspect them like a rich old miser. I held everything in those hands. I held an entire world in my unstrung, waveless interior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her I found a rich, joyful life, and a misery that—maybe because we tasted it together—immediately increased to the point that it became happiness. On my tongue I tasted things I’d never tasted before. Unknown dreams flew before my eyes, colored, like Disney films. Then the door would be unlatched and the shrimpmonger and his wife would came back into the room. From the other room the in-out of the sleeping kids’ breath drifted in, the shrimpmonger’s elderly mother talking to herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d never set eyes on the shrimpmonger’s house during daylight. Then one day I’m ringing, going in to wait for Yorgiya before night falls. The shrimpmonger’s house consisted of two rooms. With the door that separates them opened, it seems like one corridor. They seat me in their conjugal bedroom. I’m sitting in the divan in front of the windows overlooking the street. There’s a Singer sewing machine and a few paper bags next to me. Stuck up on the wall to the right of the doors, just above the bed, a European-style fabric meant to resemble a carpet. At the edge of the footboard a mirror with two pictures stuck to it. Half in sight under the bed was an upturned sewing basket, a carpenter-made toy car for kids. Closer to the divan, some mirrored cabinet that shows a man at his best. I’m overcome with curiosity to see what’s inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I’m picking up a neatly arranged pink paper pincushion, my eye is caught by a bright and shiny set of scales hanging on the wall. I set the pincushion into the bottom drawer of a dresser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time is passing. Outside it’s hailing. The way a room can darken in one moment. I’d just said a few words into the mirror. The lines on my face and my swollen eyelids—just a moment ago, when I was talking to myself in the mirror, I could see them clear as day. But now as it grows dark I find an almost young, attractive but desolate man. I find myself talking to the mirror:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sir, there’s no reason for us to fool each other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However hastily I might have said it, Sofiya calls out as she is trying to bring the burning grill inside:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She’ll come. Don’t worry! If she doesn’t come I’ll go get her from her house.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not worried a bit, madame,” I say. “She’ll come for sure  . . . Even with this hail.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let it come down! Our stove is already lit. Don’t be afraid. Should I bring it in? It smells a little, but . . .”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t bring it in for God’s sake. It bothers me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll throw a few cloves on it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t bring it in here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll leave it where it is so it goes to the girl’s head, right? You old letch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In two months I’d grown old. I was angry more with the mirror than with Madame Sofia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Faithless mirror!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What did you say?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not to you, Sofiya, to the mirror!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madame Sofiya goes on talking. I’m not listening. How much furniture is there in this room! They call this a commode? Let them call it whatever they want . . . Let’s say it’s a commode already. Next to it there’s a needlepoint picture:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a horse and carriage, next to a man with a black beard and a fur coat, the carriage driver with his bushy moustache sits motionless, not bothering himself with the horses’ progress. Now I notice a girl tucked up next to the bearded man. The girl’s face is invisible. She’s got a white fur on. A dog runs alongside the horses, but judging by the running of the carriage the dog appears motionless, almost still. It must be an error in the picture. As if I know anything about pictures!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a knock on the glass. She came early tonight . . . I feel a tremor somewhere inside myself, as if I’m the room, as if I’m the glass. I call out that I can’t get the door open:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Madame! Madame!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She shouts from inside:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard. I heard!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smell of bad charcoal mixed with the smell of cloves from the inner room . . . Mixed with a beautiful smell redolent of hashish, this girl whose eyes are so far from me, her hair wrapped in a red handkerchief—who is she? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I open the bottle. The smell of cloves flies off and the smell of anise fills the room. The hail stops. A plate of cold shrimp, red, as if from flames.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It starts as a fragment of sky</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">that detaches itself from the stratosphere,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">something in my eye as I look up.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I call it the Land of the Dead,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">its messenger gliding toward me,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">star-ermine cape scalloped with black wings,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">to land at the foot of the kapok tree</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">between buttresses</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">that remind me of the house we lived in once—</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">you said a gale had ripped off its roof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furniture inside for the afterlife—</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and you laid out on the table,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">a skeleton curled like a foetus</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">that the king vultures pierce,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">their beaks inside your bowel,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">their heads painted with prisms,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">their white eyes haloed with red.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kings of light</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">who once wore the constellations as headdresses,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">death eaters</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">now bringing up lumps of your flesh,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">putrid at first, then sweet.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maggots shrink back into eggs, flies buzz to their pupas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I sniff I can smell the stink that’s followed me ever since you died.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Who knows what the mind can do</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">but here your corpse</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">is becoming fragrant,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">your face pointed east where the sun rises</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">as our family arrives,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">their tears flowing up, back into their eyes,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">their tissues folded into pockets.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">They hug each other then carry you</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">into the hut, remove the herbs</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">packed in your heart, your intestines.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A brush paints backwards, removing the annatto dye</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">that’s protected me against your ghost, </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">dressing me in red jaguar clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the surgeons arrive, scrub their hands, peel on stained </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">white gloves and green masks</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and unpick the stitches across your abdomen,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">a scalpel erases its cut,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">iodine is wiped off your skin.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You wake as you are counting backwards. When you get to one,</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">the anaesthetist’s needle pops out of the cannula on your hand</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and as the gurney is wheeled down corridors</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">the sedative wears off.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you’re back in the ward, anti-psychotics</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">sucked out of your blood into the saline drip.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Poisons rush up syringes; pills appear on your tongue</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and fly back into nurses’ hands.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your teeth plant themselves in your gums</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and you menstruate.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrinkles smooth themselves out</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">as your hair grows auburn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here comes the hard part, the Land of the Dead</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">floating just above my head</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">because all along as you’ve been healing</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been getting smaller until</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a newborn, resting against</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">the buttress of your thigh, a liana</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">linking me to you from my navel.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The kapok tree drops a shower of red blooms around me</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">as I cry out and take a sharp breath.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m lifted up, lowered into the ledge of your womb</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">where I settle in a foetal position facing east.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The king vultures have followed me in</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and someone is zipping up my roof with a scalpel.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I squeeze my eyelids shut and my eyes sink into their sockets </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">then vanish.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My lips close and fuse. </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My ears no longer hear your heart. </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve gone back as far as I can. You must do the work now</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">my pregnant mother, you who once told me</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">what your psychiatrist said—that</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">you should never have had children.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You were crying at the time and I consoled you</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">in the hall of my bedsit, cradling the black phone. </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The vultures stayed with me all my life. I wake some nights</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">and their starry heads are above me, as they were</span><br />

<p>I mention <em>Invisible Cities</em> because it is the only point of comparison I can make to Amy Benson’s new book, <em>Seven Years to Zero</em>. Like Calvino, Benson has created a book that eludes easy classification, its contents part personal essay and part ekphrastic prose poem. But rather than using invented cities or dreams as a framework to explore human behavior, she looks to art, both real and imagined, to illuminate our fears and desires.</p>
<p><em>Seven Years of Zero</em> tells the story of a nameless couple who moves to a city that resembles New York in the midst of a changing climate and the debris of late-stage capitalism. Although the sea levels are rising and plastic bags are suffocating landfills, the couple decides to have a child. Benson scaffolds their journey through a series of close readings of art shows, which, stripped largely of their context and provenance, become poignant and fantastical ciphers.</p>
<p>Building on the truism that good art writing expands the resonance of a work rather than limiting it, Benson allows each piece to become a universe into itself, whether it is a sculpture that collects visitors’ obsessive thoughts, an imagined installation on the grounds of Chernobyl, or the objects and materials of our daily lives. Living in a city where experiences of nature are increasingly rarified and commoditized, Benson argues that art plays an important role in how we understand our changing relationship to the planet. Each chapter in <em>Seven Years to Zero</em> is an experiment in attention and perception, challenging how we look at a work of art, at the lives we build, or at our connection to the collective “we.”</p>
<p>Benson lives with her husband, the artist Douglas Repetto, and their son in Memphis, Tennessee, where she teaches at Rhodes College. She is the author of one other book, <em>The Sparkling-Eyed Boy, </em>and the co-founder of the First Person Plural reading series in Harlem. Recently, we spent a morning chatting over FaceTime about her book, contemporary art, the first person plural, and the future of the human species.</p>
<p><em>—Julia Bosson for </em>Guernica</p>
<p><strong>Guernica:</strong> I&#8217;m always interested in new beginnings. What was the genesis of this project? There are so many threads that connect these essays, but each piece feels spontaneous, like an immediate reaction to a work of art. When did you begin to realize that you were writing a collection of essays rather than flash takes?</p>
<p><strong>Amy Benson:</strong> I was working on a book project about a story in my family’s history (I had an uncle who died in Germany during the Berlin Airlift, and a lot of mysteries lingered, especially for my mother). I had done research in Germany, and I had four hundred pages of a draft that just didn&#8217;t seem to work. I was dreading returning to it. I had images in my mind where I thought, “I&#8217;m going to have to go in there with dynamite and blow it up.” This big piece of concrete is sitting in front of me, and I don&#8217;t even know how to get in there and work with it. Just before I had to get to it, I wrote two short completely unexpected essays.</p>
<p>I think the very first one was “Ribcage,” a piece about the Storm King sculpture garden. The second was the piece about my husband’s sculpture, the squirrel cage, “Claw Inside the Skull.” They came right in a row. And I felt so much relief. This was the writing I had been trying to do for a long time. Essays that had more breath and playfulness in them. Those essays also came out of years of trial and error, and of reading work that matched my sensibility. Work by John Berger, Eliot Weinberger, Claudia Rankine, Bernard Cooper, Anne Carson, Sherman Alexie.</p>
<p>I wrote those two pieces a week before I found I was pregnant. I really thought that the baby brought them. I say that facetiously, but there was an odd feeling that it gave to me that I could do what I want. I am no worshipper of maternity, but being pregnant gave me almost a sense of license, even before I knew about the pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>The book is written in the first person plural. This creates an invitation, of sorts: the audience is pulled along with you into the art. You are also the founder of a reading series about the first person plural. How did you come upon that as the language or the voice of this book? What sort of opportunities does that open and what challenges were present in that?</p>
<p><strong>Amy Benson:</strong> I read some pieces long ago, and I loved that weird feeling of the voice: I found it spooky, interesting, and unsettling. Personally, I had gravitated toward the first person plural for a long time in my writing and had been told for years to stop doing it. The response was, “<em>You</em> may feel that way, but <em>we</em> don&#8217;t anything.” But it was one of those things that I couldn&#8217;t help. I couldn&#8217;t begin to take in the criticism because it was just part of what I reached for, instinctively, apparently. But I feel like I finally found a way that works, a home for the voice. Now, I find this experience very helpful in talking to students: when someone tells you that something is failing in your work, you can often add a “yet” to that. Maybe something does not work at all, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that some of the gestures won&#8217;t have a home someday.</p>
<p>In this project, I knew that I did not want the interiority of the “I.” I did not want to conjure any of the things that &#8220;I&#8221; seems to require, like the feelings and the personal backstory. To me, it&#8217;s not a psychological book at all. It&#8217;s atmospheric and ecological. I’m not making a blanket statement about the use of the first person singular, because I think there are lots of first person experiences and voices that have never been represented—and need to be. But also, I&#8217;m persuaded by the theories about hive mind and the question of what is individuality in our culture now. It has always been somewhat of a farce. Certainly, it&#8217;s there to prop up dominant power groups. Who gets to be an individual? Who gets to have feelings and to explore those feelings in depth?</p>
<p>I was sick of that first person singular psychological interiority, which I’d employed in my first book, <span style="font-style: normal !msorm;"><em>The Sparkly-Eyed Boy</em></span>. I worked that to death, and I was not interested in writing another personal memoir. That was the challenge for this book—and maybe for the reader, then, too. I am using “we” throughout when it really is “me” having these thoughts and experiences. But I felt like I was trying to get closer to a sense of the demographics of the future. We have used a lot of earth&#8217;s resources to prop up a sense of individuality, personal identity, privacy, comfort, and property. If we don&#8217;t have that in the future, how do we get comfortable with our interdependence and fragility? How could embracing that actually become part of the good that we might be able to do instead of trying to continue to demarcate and champion and prop up that sense of the all-important &#8220;I&#8221;?</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>The “we” in this book is a constantly shifting force. “We” ranges from an individual couple to a mother and child; from viewers of art to the creators of it; from city dwellers to the human race.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Benson:</strong> I wanted the first person plural to be all-purpose. I wanted the book to feel like art and not be grounded or waylaid or brought down by those other kinds of questions about who the speaker was or where we were. I wanted it to be a little blurry. I wanted to unhook it from the personal. I wanted you to keep experiencing it as a strange fog that you walk into and then stumble out of, in the way you might experience a work of art. I was a little jealous of the way that artists can use personal material but aren’t weighed down by the same personal questions that people level at literature. When you read art criticism, it&#8217;s unlikely to be biographical criticism, but that’s absolutely what happens to a book. And so I was trying to position the book so that it might have a better chance to be independent from me in some way. At one point I imagined, if I was asked for an author&#8217;s photo, it would just be a crowd with the back of my head somewhere.</p>
<p>There was a moment in the “Year 6” preface that I come back to more than I thought I would. “We are in it. We are in it. We are in it. We are in it.” That&#8217;s the hope of the first person plural: a pervasive feeling of mystery but also the sense that we&#8217;re not exempt in any way. We are not special. It is about this vast experience of being alive on the earth at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>So many pieces in this book have to do with our changing experience of nature and our planet. In some ways, living in the city, we have to travel to “experience” nature just as we have to travel to experience art. Can you speak to the connection between art, nature, and urban life?</p>
<p><strong>Amy Benson:</strong> I wanted them to start to feel indistinguishable in the book. That we want to keep up this divide between places with human density and “natural” places. But I think that’s pretty farcical for the most part now that humans and our by-products are so pervasive. And I think it’s a symptom of human exceptionalism. Our refusal to accept that we’re an animal species, among many. And I like the idea of art that plays at the fringes between made and natural things, like Nina Katchadourian “mending” spider webs with red thread or Andy Goldsworthy painting trails of water through the city and documenting their disappearance. Those seem like gestures that are very much at peace with a decentralized view of humanity. And it seems like it’s worth the effort to get close to that way of being and seeing.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>I am interested in your choice to leave out the title of the work and the name of the artist from many of the chapters. Reading about art without the context reminded me how magical and fantastical art can be.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Benson:</strong> By not, for the most part, anyway, naming the artists and art works, I hoped the book read like a bubble. Like a cloud you walk into and then out of again. One thing that I didn&#8217;t want to do was to slight the artist in some way or to feel like I wasn&#8217;t crediting them for their incredible work. At one point as I was writing the book, I wondered if it should have photographs of the work. I immediately rejected that. It can be great to have photograph, but it becomes a paging back and forth experience. These essays are meant to be a leap into an imaginative space, both for me and the reader.</p>
<p>When I started working with my publisher, Dzanc, they had some questions about what is nonfiction and what isn&#8217;t nonfiction. But they just got more and more comfortable with the book being a mix. First, we talked about having a statement of some sort, defining what was actual and what was imagined. It&#8217;s not an interesting gesture to me that anybody would be tricked into thinking that I was trying to pass off something untrue as true. Then, we thought we would include in the back of the book a list of the artists and which chapters they appear in, which would then imply that those chapters that don&#8217;t have an artist associated with them are invented. And I had been amenable to that level of clarity—the last thing I want is for a reader to feel betrayed because there are a few invented artists and art works mixed in with the actual ones. By the time we got to the final proofs, they embraced the idea of the book just being itself, living independently in some way.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>There seems to be a new string of crises every day, and even trying to understand the impact of something like the plastic bags we get in stores or the coffee we drink can be overwhelming. What seems to have resulted is a silence—we aren’t really talking about what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Benson:</strong> I’ve taught for a while a class on lyric essays, and in it I develop a case about the kind of attention required of you by difficult or mysterious works or new forms. And that care and participation is linked in some way to citizenship. That that kind of reading is part of and practice for being responsible out there in the world. I don&#8217;t know how much faith I have left in that idea. But that&#8217;s my hope.</p>
<p>And it’s my hope that deep care and attention is part of what we do when we make things, either with words or with materials, and part of what we might get sometimes from an audience. I forget to pay attention or get overwhelmed and depressed, and then I&#8217;m reminded over and over again by things that I see, by things that I read. How closely to look and to read and to see and perceive and to question my perceptions. Art and literary writing are my favorite ways to have those reminders.</p>
<p><strong>Guernica: </strong>How do we maintain our optimism? What&#8217;s your optimism practice?</p>
<p><strong>Amy Benson:</strong> That&#8217;s one of the things I am trying to figure out. I deeply love John Berger. In a documentary about him, there is a point where he vehemently reacts against optimism. He says, essentially, “Hope, I have hope. Not optimism.” I am still trying to figure out the difference between the two. I don&#8217;t know how to talk about these things without sounding callous or cruel. I have a biology degree. I was always interested in evolution, and I do tend to think in terms of larger gestures. I remember when I was in grad school, a friend was talking about the idea of the human species being annihilated, and I was kind of like, “Well yeah, that could happen.” He was appalled that I wasn&#8217;t more upset that all of this history of thought and art could be destroyed. But this is what happens to species—they change or they die out—and it is ridiculous to think that this wouldn&#8217;t happen to us. I don&#8217;t want to ignore the pain and the horrors that people face in the present and will face in the future. But people are full of energy and invention and resourcefulness even when we&#8217;re not thinking about species annihilation or adaptation. It’s one of the theories of human evolution, right? That humans evolved the mental capacity that they did through extremely adverse conditions.</p>
<p>As an example, every generation is mourning the demise of the English language. People are always panicking that our language, our culture is in decline. That&#8217;s ridiculous. We are very attached to these things that we know and that we rely on now. But things change and we adapt. One hundred and fifty years ago we couldn&#8217;t have imagined a landscape crossed by wires and roads and here we are. I think that&#8217;s why I had to have that imagined chapter about the artists moving to the area around Chernobyl. It is fascinating how those areas bounce back, without human beings. Even under great stress, biological life is still productive and fecund and weird and things survive in different ways. It&#8217;s different from what we know now. I&#8217;m always battling in myself between attachment and acceptance.</p>

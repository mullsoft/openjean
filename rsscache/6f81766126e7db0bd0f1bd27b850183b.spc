<p>The film industry has similarly grasped the lucrative potential of merfolk. Last year, China’s highest grossing film of all time, Stephen Chow’s The Mermaid (美人鱼/美人魚), used the creatures to foreground mankind’s destructive effect on the environment. With four new Hollywood mer-movies currently in the pipeline – three inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid, and a remake of the 1984 comedy Splash featuring <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/01/channing-tatum-mermaid-splash-remake">Channing Tatum</a> as a merman – merfolk are poised to dominate the media for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2>Beautiful beasts</h2>

<p>All of this might give the impression that the world has suddenly gone mer-crazy – but the pre-eminence of mermaids as cultural icons has long been apparent. Merfolk have been with mankind since the dawn of civilisation, inspiring stories, art and religious iconography, featuring in our politics, and helping us to navigate complex emotions and questions about the human condition. </p>

<p>In ancient Mesopotamia, half-human, half-fish creatures were believed to inhabit the primordial waters from which all life sprang. Their presence on amulets and buildings from this region suggests they had a protective function, warding off evil and bringing good luck to people and places. Atargatis, a Syrian goddess who appears to have had a fish-tail in one of her iconographical forms, similarly afforded protection to her followers, safeguarding fertility, order and justice. And let’s not forget the pantheon of marine deities that the Greeks, Etruscans and Romans honoured. The latter influenced medieval portrayals of mermaids and their deadly cousins the sirens, who had started to transform from seaside dwelling bird-women to fishtailed maidens by the seventh century. </p>

<p>In the Middle Ages, the medieval church used mermaids and sirens to teach Christians about sin and salvation. Twelfth-century Bestiaries, or Book of Beasts, provided allegorical readings of the sirens as emblems of worldly pleasures and sin, while the 14th-century Cornish plays known as the <em>Ordinalia</em> employed the hybrid body of the mermaid (part woman, part fish) to explain the dual nature of Christ incarnate (part man, part God). </p>

<p>Though the use of mermaids in a religious context ended with the Reformation, their presence in other media – in drama and poetry, on maps, decorative architecture, jewellery, tableware, tavern signs and inns – increased exponentially, prompting English author and scientist Thomas Browne to declare in 1646 that: “Few eyes have escaped the picture of mermaids.”</p>

<h2>Mer-politics</h2>

<p>By the 16th century, mermaids were also being used in political contexts. Mary, Queen of Scots, was depicted as a mermaid on a placard posted in Edinburgh following the murder of her husband, Lord Darnley. </p>

<figure class="align-left ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/177392/width237/file-20170707-4444-6ovmi4.jpg">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Implicating Mary and her future husband, James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, in the (still unsolved) murder, the placard drew public attention to a longstanding tradition that equated mermaids with prostitutes by presenting Mary as a mermaid beguiling Bothwell in the form of a hare, one of his heraldic badges. Just a few years later, the mermaid was recycled as a positive sign of English mastery over the sea, as Mary’s cousin, Elizabeth I, was painted next to an elaborate mermaid chair in a portrait celebrating the defeat of the Spanish Armada. </p>

<h2>Merfolk and money</h2>

<p>Though the Age of Enlightenment saw the phenomena of merfolk subjected to greater scientific scrutiny, some individuals exploited people’s natural curiosity about the sea and its inhabitants by exhibiting fake mermaids. At least five mermaids were on show in fairs and exhibitions in London between 1775 and 1795. </p>

<p>The contorted specimen that was displayed between September 1822 and January 1823 in the Turf Coffeehouse on St James Street provides a good example of the money such specimens could generate. Hundreds of spectators paid one shilling to see it – as various publications reported on its authenticity, condemned it as a forgery, or charted the incredible story of its acquisition (the owner, Captain Samuel Barrett Eades, had sold a ship that didn’t belong to him to fund the purchase). Two decades later, the same mermaid crossed the Atlantic and become P.T. Barnum’s most notorious attraction. </p>

<p>From the 19th century to the present day, artists have harnessed the erotic aesthetic of the mermaid’s form to navigate female sexuality and human desire, producing works as diverse as John William Waterhouse’s <a href="http://www.racollection.org.uk/ixbin/indexplus?record=O1243">A Mermaid</a> (1900) and René Magritte’s <a href="https://www.renemagritte.org/the-collective-invention.jsp">The Collective Invention</a> (1934). Meanwhile, writers such as <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43589/the-forsaken-merman">Matthew Arnold</a>, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/44212/the-love-song-of-j-alfred-prufrock-56d2233846c6d">T.S. Eliot</a> and <a href="http://www.beautiful-mermaid-art.com/mermaid-story-4.html">Oscar Wilde</a> have woven their imaginative power into literary explorations of love and loss, old age and sexual inadequacy, and the isolation of modernity.</p>

<p>It is this flexibility that has allowed the mermaid to endure as an icon across cultures and across time. As a creature of duality, belonging to two worlds, the mermaid embodies contradiction and unity – she is a bendable cipher that absorbs and transforms whatever hopes, ambitions, anxieties and fears we imprint upon her. Though it might seem that the 21st century has the edge on romanticising, ecologising, feminising and politicising the mermaid to better understand ourselves, we are merely following in our ancestors footsteps in succumbing to her ancient charms.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80086/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

In the case of artists, this goes a long way back. Artists have long been seen as unusual – people with a different way of perceiving reality. Famously, the French architect <a href="http://www.editions-linteau.com/livres/lespace-indicible/">Le Corbusier</a> argued in 1946 that painters, sculptors and architects are equipped with a “feeling of space” in a very fundamental sense. </p>

<p>Artists have to think about reality in different ways to other people every day in their jobs. Painters have to create an imaginary 3D image on a 2D plane, performing a certain magic. Sculptors turn a block of marble into something almost living. Architects can design buildings that would seem impossible. </p>

<p>Think of <a href="http://www.metanamorph.com">Edgar Mueller’s famous street art</a>. Or <a href="http://www.italianrenaissance.org/michelangelos-pieta/">Michaelangelo’s Pietà</a>. Or Frank Lloyd Wright’s <a href="http://franklloydwright.org/site/fallingwater/">Fallingwater</a>, which seems to defy physics. All of these people are (or were) experts in rearranging the spatial relationships in their environment, each in their own way. This is a necessary skill for anyone who takes up these crafts as a profession. How could this not affect the ways in which they think – and talk – about space?</p>

<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12510/full">Our recent study</a>, a <a href="https://www.bangor.ac.uk/news/research/artists-and-architects-think-differently-compared-to-other-people-32616">collaboration of UCL and Bangor University</a>, set out to test this. Do architects, painters, and sculptors conceive of spaces in different ways from other people and from each other? The answer is: yes, they do – in a range of quite subtle ways. </p>

<p>Painters, sculptors, architects (all “spatial” professionals with at least eight years of experience) and a group of people in unrelated (“non-spatial”) professions took part in the study. There were 16 people in each professional group, with similar age range and equal gender distribution. They were shown a Google Street view image, a painting of St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican and a computer-generated surreal scene. </p>

<figure class="align-center ">

<p>For each picture, they were given a few tasks that made them think about the spatial scene in certain ways: they were asked to describe the environment, explain how they would explore the space shown and suggest changes to it in the image. This picture-based task was chosen because of its simplicity – it doesn’t take an expert to describe a picture or to imagine exploring or changing it.</p>

<p>From the answers, we categorised elements of the responses for both qualitative and quantitative analyses using a new technique called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2014.19">Cognitive Discourse Analysis</a> with the aim of highlighting aspects of thought that underlie linguistic choices beyond what speakers are consciously aware of. We made a short film about the research which you can watch below.</p>

<h2>Telltale language</h2>

<p>Our analysis led to the identification of consistent patterns in the language used for talking about the pictures that were revealing. Painters, sculptors and architects all gave more elaborate, detailed descriptions than the others.</p>

<p>Painters were more likely to describe the depicted space as a 2D image and said things like: “It’s obvious the image wants you to follow the boat off onto the horizon.” They tended to shift between describing the scene as a 3D space or as a 2D image. By contrast, architects were more likely to describe barriers and boundaries of the space – as in: “There are voids within walls which become spaces in their own right.” Sculptors’ responses were between the two – they were somewhat like architects except for one measure: with respect to the bounded descriptions of space, they appeared more like painters. </p>

<p>Painters and architects also differed in how they described the furthest point of the space, as painters called it the “back” and architects called it the “end”. The “non-spatial” group rarely used either one of these terms – instead they referred to the same location by using other common spatial terms such as “centre” or “bottom” or “there”. All of this had nothing to do with expert language or register – obviously people can talk in detail about their profession. But our study reflected the way they think about spatial relationships in a task that did not require their expertise. </p>

<p>The “non-spatial” group did not experience any problems with the task – but their language seemed less systematic and less rich than that of the three spatial professional groups.</p>

<h2>Thinking and talking like a professional</h2>

<p>Our career may well change the way we think, in somewhat unexpected ways. In the late 1930s, American linguist <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-349-25582-5_35">Benjamin Lee Whorf</a> suggested that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-language-shapes-thought/">the language we speak affects the way we think</a> – and this triggered extensive <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521812627">research</a> into how culture changes cognition. Our study goes a step further – it shows that even within the same culture, people of different professions differ in how they appreciate the world.</p>

<figure class="align-center ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/177558/width754/file-20170710-5970-7ouap2.jpg">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>The findings also raise the possibility that people who are already inclined to see the world as a 2D image, or who focus on the borders of a space, may be more inclined to pursue painting or architecture. This also makes sense – perhaps we develop our thinking in a particular way, for whatever reasons, and this paves our way towards a particular profession. Perhaps architects, painters and sculptors already talked in their own fashion about spatial relationships, before they starting their careers. </p>

<p>This remains to be looked at in detail. But it’s clear from our study that artists and architects have a heightened awareness of their surroundings which is reflected in the way they talk about spatial environments. So next time you are at dinner with an architect, painter, or sculptor, show them a photograph of a landscape and get them to describe it – and see if you can spot the telltale signs of their profession slipping out.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80505/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>This imperative in Thoreau towards contraction rather than expansion made enemies of those in his period who were committed to America’s dizzying industrial and technological progress: “I prefer walking on two legs,” Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier sniffily remarked. And if Thoreau’s contemporaries sometimes recoiled in distaste from his radical downsizing, even greater resistance to his work might be anticipated from readers in our own moment. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau">Thoreau</a>, born 200 years ago on July 12 1817, appears at first glance strikingly ill-adapted for the modern West. While it has long been fashionable to assert that, were he alive now, Shakespeare would seamlessly have tweaked his creative mode and written for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006m86d">EastEnders</a>, few would make comparable predictions of Thoreau’s success in the contemporary mediascape. The only Twittersphere to interest him would be that occupied by blue-jays and redstarts. Impossible to imagine, also, is him uploading to Instagram photos of his cabin at Walden, or of Maine woodlands and Cape Cod beaches (subjects of two other major books).</p>

<p>Even the slowly dribbling “news feed” of mid-19th-century New England was seemingly too much for Thoreau, experienced as irritation to the point of pain. “For my part, I could easily live without the post-office,” he writes in Walden, seemingly excusing himself from circuits of worldly communication in order to retreat more effectively into the contemplative mode he practises by his Massachusetts pond. A tendency in Thoreau towards inwardness or self-reliance looks startlingly out of kilter with our networked world. From Walden, again: “I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself, than be crowded on a velvet cushion.” Here is the transcendentalist appearing withdrawn, anti-social, even potentially sociopathic.</p>

<p>But if there may be something off-putting about Thoreau’s work for contemporary readers, there are also elements that should invigorate. The occasion of his bicentenary prompts us to identify several ways in which he continues to speak eloquently to us. For his critique of commodity culture and his sensitivity to environmental degradation, Thoreau has in fact never been more indispensable than he is now.</p>

<h2>Dazzled by gold</h2>

<p>One of the most damning portraits in Walden is of the ruthlessly acquisitive farmer Flint, “who would carry the landscape, who would carry his God, to market, if he could get anything for him”. Flint is mesmerised, too, by “the reflecting surface of a dollar, or a bright cent.” How can this not resonate at a time when the US president himself is dazzled almost to blindness by the gold dripping off each interior surface of Trump Tower?</p>

<p>There is a shimmering appeal to consumer products to which Thoreau is remarkably unresponsive. Few people, perhaps, will want to emulate him in the degree to which he gives up money, goods, <em>stuff</em>. But when he urges Walden’s reader to “cultivate poverty like a garden herb”, his own class privilege goes unquestioned. What about all those for whom poverty is fate, not lifestyle choice? </p>

<p>Nevertheless, Thoreau’s acute observations in Walden of how people are imprisoned or suffocated by their commodities throw down a challenge to us. Perhaps, he writes, “a man is not required to bury himself [in] superfluous property”? Thoreau is thus the laureate of decluttering, helping us to imagine alternatives to our beguilement by consumer experience.    </p>

<h2>Turning to the woods</h2>

<p>“Nature excels in the least things,” writes Thoreau in an essay titled “Huckleberries”. His own writing is similarly fine-grained in its attention to ecological detail. If he was parsimonious in domestic economy, he was prodigal in descriptions of nature, spending words extravagantly. Think, say, of the journal entry for his 34th birthday in 1851, when he evokes a skunk on a “bare garden hill”, a “foolish robin” and a “lightning bug [with its] greenish light”. Such moments valuably reawaken us to the sights and textures of our natural world, giving this potentially some traction against its erasure in favour – Trumpishly – of an oil pipeline or golf course.</p>

<p>For if there is a poetics of nature in Thoreau, there is always also a politics. His sensuous zoology and botany strikes “a counter-establishment stance”, as US literary critic Lawrence Buell <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/literature/american-literature/new-essays-walden?format=PB#ibcwwJ8ztjh3lXWi.97">puts it</a>. </p>

<p>But this is not to say that in his work Thoreau retreats complacently into the woods. Consider a moment in the essay “A Yankee in Canada” when the reddening leaves remind him of an American genocide then still in progress: “An Indian warfare was waged through the forest.” Arboreal description gives way, by a sudden change of focus, to sardonic political commentary. </p>

<p>The passage is characteristic of the social engagement of Thoreau’s writing. In reading his work as he turns 200, we do not, after all, find simply a regressive or detached figure. Rather, we encounter a writer who frequently provides us with valuable intellectual and rhetorical resources to take into our ongoing struggles in the world.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80730/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>Inflammatory clickbait, conspiracy theories and populists dismissing the mainstream media and scientific reports are challenging the ways in which people make sense of the world. I am interested in how documentary film making has been affected, and how it can respond. This was the subject of <a href="https://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/2017/docsalon-documentary-age-fake-news">a session</a> of industry professionals that I chaired at the <a href="https://www.edfilmfest.org.uk">Edinburgh International Film Festival</a>.  </p>

<p>The panel saw the internet and social media as both cause and potential cure for these problems. They amplify the speed and reach of misinformation. And because people are used to giving such material only glancing attention, it forestalls their critical engagement. </p>

<p>Long-form documentary encourages a more contemplative commitment for viewers, yet it faces challenges from an industry eager to adapt to the online space. Sonja Henrici of the <a href="https://www.scottishdocinstitute.com">Scottish Documentary Institute</a> described <a href="https://medium.com/@AnnaEHiggs/dis-content-creative-direction-in-the-audience-age-447ebfaf6b2a">a shift</a> in emphasis from storytelling to content marketing, where the widest possible distribution is the priority. </p>

<p>This means that soundbite clips of documentaries that are well liked and shared on social media have become coveted by funders and broadcasters. These videos have their appeal, but it’s not clear if social media activity translates into deeper engagement. It also risks replicating the conditions that facilitated the rise of fake news in the first place. </p>

<p>Still, it is impossible to dismiss the value of technology for documentaries. Platforms from Netflix to YouTube have increased our access to other voices. As one audience member noted, when Indian broadcasters refused to support documentaries made by and about Dalit, those at the bottom of the caste system, YouTube offered a means of watching and exchanging such <a href="https://www.dalitsolidarity.org/donate/91-documentaries-about-dalits.html">material</a>.</p>

          </figure>

<h2>The gatekeepers</h2>

<p>One <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/apr/25/mmr-scare-analysis">marked example</a> of fake news as documentary is arguably the 2016 film <a href="http://vaxxedthemovie.com">Vaxxed</a>. Directed by former gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield, it reasserts his <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/">discredited 1998 claims</a> of links between the MMR vaccine and autism.  </p>

<p>Vaxxed was scheduled for both the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/nyregion/anti-vaccine-film-pulled-from-tribeca-film-festival-draws-crowd-at-showing.html?_r=0">Tribeca Film Festival</a> in New York and a <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/vaxxed-anti-vaxx-documentary-screening-uk-2017-1">Curzon cinema</a> in central London, but both cancelled following negative publicity. On the other hand, the film is available <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vaxxed-Cover-Up-Catastrophe-Del-Bigtree/dp/B01NA0ESU7">on Amazon</a>, in an example of the reluctance of internet platforms to make value judgements about their content. </p>

<figure class="align-center zoomable">
            <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/177332/area14mp/file-20170707-29852-hldfoy.png"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/177332/width754/file-20170707-29852-hldfoy.png"></a>
            <figcaption>
              <span class="caption">Not coming to a cinema near you.</span>
              
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>This case highlights the role of exhibitors, funders and distributors as gatekeepers who decide access to a documentary that could potentially cause harm. Despite my own agreement with the cancellations, this touches on broader questions about what it means to use “truth” and “harm” in deciding what should be publicly available. After all, yesterday’s accepted knowledge can be considered oppressive or dangerous today.  </p>

<p>Science is grounded in social biases – <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-9-most-influential-works-of-scientific-racism-rank-1575543279">race science and eugenics</a> may be the best example; women’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/30/fda-clinical-trials-gender-gap-epa-nih-institute-of-medicine-cardiovascular-disease">long exclusion</a> from medical research is another. Documentaries that counter official stories – in history or science – are therefore crucial. <a href="https://sheffdocfest.com/articles/440-luke-w-moody-appointed-as-director-of-film-programming">Luke Moody</a>, film programming director of the <a href="https://sheffdocfest.com">Sheffield Doc/Fest</a>, stressed to the Edinburgh audience the need for a range of voices at a film festival, including opinion-based work. </p>

<h2>History of misdirection</h2>

<p>The panel also pointed out that fake news and post-truth is nothing new. Documentary makers have been blurring the boundaries of fiction and nonfiction ever since Louis Lumière instructed his workers to exit his factory as if they had finished a day’s work for his famous 1895 short. Experimenting to achieve maximum effect, Lumière made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1EdyZtkGXo">three versions</a> of the film. </p>

<figure>
            <iframe width="440" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1EdyZtkGXo?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            
          </figure>

<p>Richard Warden, a documentary producer and film lead for the Mental Health Foundation UK, made a similar point about the 1855 Crimean War photo “<a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/308563-truth-cannonballs/">The Valley of the Shadow of Death</a>”. Taken by the pioneering British photographer Roger Fenton, cannonballs were placed in shot for dramatic emphasis. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1250210/">Flora Gregory</a>, a documentary consultant and former commissioning editor for Witness, Al-Jazeera English’s documentary strand, said the conflict between a free press and authoritarian leaders is also age-old. It may seem like a novelty in the West with the arrival of Trump and other populists, but that’s not the case.  </p>



<p>When Oxford Dictionaries <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/word-of-the-year/word-of-the-year-2016">made post-truth</a> its word of 2016, it was not because it was new but because usage had increased in relation to the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election. </p>

<p>Indeed, US comedian Stephen Colbert <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-colbert-report-truthiness-clip-2014-12">introduced “truthiness”</a> in 2005 to mean preferring concepts or facts one wishes or believes to be true to those that are true. He was applying this to the Iraq war, which is a reminder that fakery can have very real effects. </p>

<p>While discussing the range of perspectives offered through documentary, the panel also noted that national broadcasters can influence the truths audiences witness. <a href="http://www.larmfilm.dk/en/feras-fayyad/">Firas Fayyad</a>, director of the award-winning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/24/last-men-in-aleppo-review-sundance-film-festival-white-helmets-syria">Last Men in Aleppo</a>, recounted how an earlier short observational film about children in Syria was shaped by two broadcasters’ differing priorities. </p>

<p>Broadcasters are beholden to perceived national preferences, Flora Gregory added. In the UK, they often prioritise presenter-led documentaries. Observational films on difficult subjects without voiceover or interviews can struggle to get picked up. </p>

<figure class="align-center ">

          </figure>

<p>In short, the historic challenges in making documentaries risk being exacerbated by online echo chambers and those in public life seeking to exploit them. It redoubles film makers’ duty to trade in honest portrayals and encourage deep reflection. Meanwhile, I hope broadcasters and exhibitors do not shy away from challenging subjects and experimentation in response to fake news. </p>

<p>I don’t see any general deterioration in the commitment from documentary makers to telling these complicated stories. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80000770">Making a Murderer</a>, and Last Men in Aleppo are two examples.</p>

<p>Yet in these testing times for facts, the future can definitely not be taken for granted.

Surely this has little to do with mathematical models which are so frequently associated with cold and rational logic. So what can maths tell us about this powerful phenomenon closely connected to the emotions? Can mathematics help us measure what’s sublime or ineffable about a piece of music?</p>

<p>Music evokes strong emotions such as <a href="http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2008-2009/Huron/HuronFrisson.pdf">frisson</a> (goose bumps), awe and laughter – and has been found to use the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep41952">same reward pathways as food, drugs and sex</a> to induce pleasure. A shiver down one’s spine or an uncontrollable guffaw when listening to music is most often a case of the music defying your expectations. Expectations can be defined in two ways: schematic – knowing how a genre of music is supposed to go – or veridical – knowing how a particular piece of music unfolds.</p>

<p>On one end of the spectrum, a performance or a piece of music that does just what you’d expect runs the risk of becoming banal. On the other end, music like that of <a href="https://www.schickele.com/">PDQ Bach</a> – which uses tongue-in-cheek egregious violations of known expectations – makes many people laugh.</p>

<p>The craving that comes from musical anticipation and the euphoria that follows the reward have both been found to be linked to <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n2/full/nn.2726.html">dopamine release</a>. As a result, performers and composers alike play with listeners’ expectations, often going to great lengths to carefully <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lp07ZMAczT8C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=tendency+and+expectation+in+music+leonard+meyer+emotion+and+meaning+in+music&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0u_2spZXUAhWKIcAKHQyNDp0Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=tendency%20and%20expectation%20in%20music%20leonard%20meyer%20emotion%20and%20meaning%20in%20music&amp;f=false">choreograph their expectations</a>, and then sometimes breaking them, to provoke and heighten emotional responses. </p>

<h2>Playing with expectations</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/6401/whats-the-difference-between-modal-music-and-tonal-music">tonal music</a>, which is almost all of the music that we hear and can be thought of as being based on a scale, the note sequence sets up expectations, then suspends, fulfils, or violates them. For a simple example, sing the first three phrases of “Happy Birthday” and stop at the end of the penultimate phrase.</p>

<p><audio preload="metadata" controls="controls" data-duration="13" data-image="" data-title="Happy Birthday (first part)" data-size="290510" data-source="EC" data-source-url="" data-license="Author provided" data-license-url="">

      </div></p>

<p>Anticipation for the resolution to this musical cliffhanger creates a palpable knot in the gut. This hollow feeling can be further intensified by delaying the final phrase. The release is evident when the final phrase is heard and ends happily on the most stable tone.</p>

<p><audio preload="metadata" controls="controls" data-duration="7" data-image="" data-title="Happy Birthday (second part)" data-size="159256" data-source="EC" data-source-url="" data-license="Author provided" data-license-url="">

<p>Two things are at work here in this miniature example: tonality and time. Tonality provides a framework through which expectations are formed – and the play on time, the delaying of expectations, uses the framework to create a musical cliffhanger and titillate the senses.</p>

<h2>Where maths comes in</h2>

<p>Expectations can be modelled mathematically and time can be measured – so the shaping of both expectations and time can be described in numbers. Over the years, in my research lab, we have developed models and computer algorithms for quantifying tonal properties and expressive parameters in music. Many of the tonal analysis algorithms are based on what is known as a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_array_model">spiral array model</a>”. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461494744">spiral array</a> can be plotted in 3D to allow us to visualise the dynamic evolution of musical keys and spot when the notes and their timing combine to do something interesting to tug at our emotions.</p>

          </figure>

<p>As music is heard, the notes can be mapped to the model, duly weighted and summarised as points inside it. Movements in the space inside the model allow listeners to see deviations from expected tonal behaviour.</p>

          </figure>

<h2>Musical tension</h2>

<p>Just as pitches that sound close one to another are spatially near each other; the converse is true: pitches that sound far from one another are spatially far apart. Feelings of tension translate to quantifiably big distances – notes mapping to widely dispersed points or pulling far away from an established centre of gravity.</p>

<p>Composers actively vary the tension over time to generate interest and captivate the listener’s attention. The shaping of tension over time also helps create meaningful long-term structure. It is notoriously hard for computer algorithms to generate music with long-term structure. But the MorpheuS system, developed by music researcher Dorien Herremans, circumvents this problem to <a href="http://dorienherremans.com/MorpheuS">generate music with a pre-set narrative structure</a> by using a tension model based on the spiral array. Listen to this version of JS Bach’s “Minuet in D”:</p>

      </div></p>

<p>It follows the tension profile, rhythms, and repetition patterns of the original piece from A Little Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach:</p>

      </div></p>

<p>The notes of the generated piece also conjures up similar degrees of tension to the original music. For example, discordant sounds follows the same patterns of discord in Bach’s original piece.</p>

<h2>Tipping points</h2>

<p>Not only do notes themselves create tension, a performer can delay resolutions to heighten suspense. Judicious use of timing is one of the most potent expressive devices for eliciting emotional responses. The right amount of delay can sweeten the anticipation – but take too much time and the performer risks losing the listener. </p>

<p>In music with a beat, the musical pulse forms a baseline grid on which to measure timing deviations – prolongations and reductions of the time unit. In extreme cases, these warpings of musical time produce <a href="http://mp.ucpress.edu/content/33/3/344">tipping points</a>, the feeling of being poised at the brink of an abstract hill in an imaginary roller coaster.</p>

<p>We can use maths to present this graphically. When a piece of music is performed precisely as written, it is displayed as a flat line in these graphs. But music is almost never played exactly as written. Performers often exercise significant creative license; as a result, anomalous peaks signal the evocation of musical tipping points.</p>

<p>By elongating specific notes – or words or syllables – the performer draws the listener’s ears to details that might have been missed or glossed over. Because the listener often knows what’s coming, the delay prolongs expectation – creating drama and exaggerating emotional cues.</p>

<p>Mathematics is the language through which scientists understand the nature of the universe. However, the extent to which numbers can explain the ephemeral experience of music has yet to be fully explored. Why does music move us? How do its variegated structures translate to musical expectations? How do performers and composers exploit these expectations to craft profound and moving musical experiences? Our mathematical forays into these questions are but the tip of the ice berg.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/74876/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

Completed in 1420, the city served as the palace of Ming Dynasty emperor, Yongle. Its walls surrounded an area large enough to contain more than 50 Buckingham Palaces, creating a private sanctuary which none but the emperor’s family and eunuchs were permitted to enter. </p>

<p>The Forbidden City became the seat of imperial power in China <a href="http://en.dpm.org.cn/EXPLORE/ming-qing/">for almost five centuries</a> and remains an important part of modern China’s cultural heritage today. But it is seldom mentioned that Yongle was not the first emperor to build in that location. In fact, underneath the streets of modern Beijing lie the remains of a much earlier palace. </p>

<p>More than 300 years before the Ming came to power, <a href="http://asiasociety.org/education/chinas-liao-dynasty">a walled city</a> was built on the site of present-day Beijing. Entering that city’s gates, you would have been greeted by another, much taller, walled complex; it was within this city within a city, that you might have found the emperors of the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41933562">long-forgotten Liao Dynasty</a>. </p>

<p>I say “might have” for good reason, as the Liao had not one capital city, but five. The Liao maintained a capital in each of the four cardinal points of their empire and still had the resources to establish another one in the middle for good measure. The emperor and his court would travel between the cities throughout the year. </p>

<p>The name Beijing itself – literally translated as “Northern Capital”, is a reflection of its position within the Ming Empire. To the Liao, however, this same city was known as Nanjing, the “Southern Capital”, revealing a very <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/research/projects/northeast-asian-cities.aspx">different world order</a>. </p>

<p>With lands stretching from Inner-Asia in the west, into Mongolia in the north, and to the Korean peninsula in the east, the Liao Dynasty was one of the major political powers in East Asia from 907 to 1125. Yet this geopolitical influence is the least of the Liao’s achievements. </p>

<p>The Liao have left us some of the finest examples of Buddhist art and architecture in all of Asia. The <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5803/">65-metre Yingxian Pagoda</a> – the oldest surviving wooden Buddhist pagoda in China – remains one of the tallest timber structures in the world. The dynasty also established administrative structures that were used throughout China’s later imperial history. The precedent for the “one country, two systems” policy – whereby different laws and codes are applied to different regions of the country – which can be seen in Hong Kong and Macau today, could arguably be dated back to the Liao administration. </p>

<h2>Missing from history</h2>

<p>Despite these lasting legacies, if you were to pick up a book on Chinese history at random, the Liao Dynasty may not even get a mention. Timelines of China’s ruling dynasties frequently omit the Liao in favour of one of their contemporaries – the Song Dynasty. Yet records from the time demonstrate that the Liao and Song were political equals. A clue as to why the Liao are often lost from these historical accounts can be found by peering over those inner walls and into the palaces of the Liao’s five imperial capitals.</p>

<p>Rather than the imposing timber-framed halls of Yongle’s Forbidden City, the Liao imperial family would instead be found living in a series of grand tents. The people who formed the Liao Dynasty originally came from the steppes of north-east Asia and lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle. They were known as the Kitan and, like most nomadic groups, history has not treated them well.</p>

<p>Despite having their own written language, only a small number of Kitan texts survive today, and translating them is often difficult because there are no surviving languages similar enough to help linguists fully decipher the characters. As a result, finding the Kitan or the Liao voice in the historical record proves to be a challenge. </p>

<p>Most of the primary sources that modern historians have for the Liao period were written under the Song Dynasty. As the Liao’s direct political rivals, the Song sources are often less than flattering about the Liao Dynasty, and its Kitan leaders. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, this attitude towards the Liao has worked its way into later sources, keeping the dynasty in the shadows. This began to change when archaeological discoveries of the late 20th century generated new interest in Liao sites. For instance, the finds at the excavation of the <a href="http://en.chinaculture.org/library/2008-01/15/content_39499.htm">tomb of Princess Chen</a>, changed the way people viewed Liao elite culture. </p>

<p>Gold and other precious metal artefacts from Liao tombs have <a href="http://sites.asiasociety.org/arts/liao/">become a major draw</a> in public exhibitions around the world. Interest among private collectors is also rising. A small, gilt-bronze, Liao Buddhist statue recently broke the record for an Asian art auction at Christie’s in France, <a href="http://www.christies.com/about-us/press-archive/details?PressReleaseID=8561&amp;lid=1">selling for €13,570,500</a>. </p>

<p>With all of this renewed interest, academic studies of the Liao are <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41650013">reassessing the dynasty’s position</a> in Chinese and wider Asian history. Historical texts are being challenged and <a href="http://news.yale.edu/2016/06/02/extinct-language-finds-new-audience-yale">progress is being made</a> on the translation of the Kitan writing system.</p>

<p>If you visit Beijing today, just about the only evidence you will find of the Liao city is <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g294212-d1980177-Reviews-Beijing_Tianning_Tower-Beijing.html">a single pagoda</a>. An ancient monument – once the tallest building in the city – it is now dwarfed by the industrial chimneys that surround it. The history of the Liao Dynasty, in contrast, has never been more visible.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80626/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>The “<a href="http://sites.middlebury.edu/soan191/files/2013/08/JenkinsWWF.pdf">masculine melodrama</a>” presented by modern professional wrestling programmes such as WWE represents the <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11199-006-9055-6.pdf">epitome of masculinity</a>, fighting in epic showdowns for a mostly male audience. Of course, there are female wrestlers – as there are female viewers – but WWE <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/real-world-womens-wrestling-behind-new-netflix-show-glow/">has in the past been criticised</a> for its poor portrayal of women. There are those who say <a href="http://dailyddt.com/2016/04/14/wwe-still-doesnt-understand-female-audience/">WWE aims its coverage</a> at “15-year-old boys who will cheer for any woman so long as she looks sexy”.</p>

<p>Against this backdrop, Netflix’s <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/06/22/glow-review-alison-brie-is-a-knockout-in-netflixs-best-new-show-of-the-year-6726043/">new hit series GLOW</a> has entered the ring. The show gives a fictional account of the real-life <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/netflixs-glow-meet-real-life-gorgeous-ladies-wrestling/">1980s wrestling television series</a> “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling”, which featured exclusively female performers. Starring Alison Brie as Ruth, a struggling actress who needs a new role in order to make a living, GLOW follows a group of women from Los Angeles who, with no prior experience, get involved in a new televised wrestling venture. </p>

<p>GLOW’s feminism is made explicit from the outset. Despite the proposed show ostensibly being about “gorgeous ladies”, the women are literally fighting the male gaze. The nuances of feminism within the show can be seen at first by the replacement of the white male trainer with Cherry Bang, a black woman. With Cherry in charge, the women find their way together, relying only on themselves to figure out how to wrestle.</p>

<p>As the series progresses, the female wrestlers become more confident in using their bodies as part of their performance, ultimately triumphing in the ring  and winning over fans with their physical prowess rather than their looks. As Cherry says to her fellow wrestlers: “We’re empowered, we’re the heroes”.</p>

<figure class="align-right ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/177322/width237/file-20170707-2989-1twf54e.jpg">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>At first glance, GLOW’s strong portrayal overtakes even the newer ideals of WWE, which has recently made small steps to embrace more explicit feminist politics. It has <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/divas-superstars-evolution-wwes-womens-division/story?id=41435217">rebranded its “Divas” division</a> as the “Women’s Revolution”, for example, now showcasing female performers who have historically been marginalised at the expense of their male counterparts.</p>

<p>Yet academics have observed that, despite lauding a catalogue of “powerful” women in their promotional materials, WWE still have not outright addressed issues such as “sexism” or “feminism”. Instead, researchers say, they fall back on the fact that “although feminism may be fashionable in many areas of popular culture, it is <a href="http://www.academia.edu/31300140/_Women_are_fighting_everywhere_Corporate_mobilisation_of_feminism_in_women_s_professional_wrestling_MeCCSA_Conference_11-13_January_2017_School_of_Media_and_Communication_University_of_Leeds">still too risky</a> to be named outright by a company with legions of male fans”.</p>

<h2>Girl gang</h2>

<p>So is there any room in the ring for female wrestlers, outside a fictional context? Definitely. London-based <a href="http://www.evewrestling.com/">Pro-Wrestling:EVE</a> sells itself as “a secret underground feminist, political, socialist, humanist, punk rock wrestling promotion, for those who identify as women and non-binary folk”.</p>

<p>Though it is aimed at fans of all genders, EVE uses wrestling to help women feel empowered. Its founder Emily Read <a href="http://www.refinery29.uk/womens-wrestling-mental-health">has noted that</a>: “It’s so conditioned in women to be quiet and small, it’s a real hindrance when it comes to wrestling. And I see women learn to be big and loud and take up space”. EVE gives women a place to enjoy being physical: promotional material shows images of bloodied faces and hard-hitting manoeuvres, adorned with slogans such as “fight like a girl”, “support your local girl gang”, and “follow your fucking dreams”.</p>

<p><blockquote class="instagram-media" style="width: 100%" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="7">
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ58DM5Fqf_/?taken-by=prowrestlingeve" target="_blank"></a>

          <script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>
          <script>window.instgrm.Embeds.process()</script></p>

<p>EVE goes further than the scripts of GLOW and political restraints of WWE could ever allow. It encourages taking the feminist physicality outside the ring and into the real world, explicitly endorsing and encouraging <a href="https://twitter.com/ProWrestlingEVE/status/880839947007258624">political activism</a>. Not only do the official social media feeds for EVE promote their wrestling brand, merchandise and events – but they are also used as a means for political communication. </p>

<p>The company posted material firmly in support of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign during the June 2017 general election, for example. And when Donald Trump recently <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/881503147168071680">used his involvement in wrestling</a> to hint at his own brand of masculinity, EVE printed a Donald Trump-a-like figure on their <a href="http://www.evewrestling.com/product/piledrive-a-fascist-t-shirt/">“piledrive a fascist” t-shirt</a> design. </p>

<p>For EVE and its supporters, women’s wrestling acts as a training ground for feminist practice and a way to build confidence to take political activism into the public arena.</p>

<p>With GLOW being such a big hit, WWE taking small but progressive steps in the right direction and EVE smashing through with a thoroughly empowered ideal, it’s about time that wrestling’s masculine image was redressed. After all, there’s no shame in fighting for your rights like a girl.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80643/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

<p>Much of our awareness of Owen’s time at Craiglockhart comes from Pat Barker’s beautifully crafted novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/book-club-pat-barker-regeneration">Regeneration</a> (1991), and Stephen MacDonald’s play <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/18/not-about-heroes-review-owen-sassoon-poetry">Not About Heroes</a> (1982). MacDonald’s work focused mainly on the relationship between Owen and fellow soldier-poet <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/siegfried-sassoon">Siegfried Sassoon</a>, while Barker focused on Sassoon and Craiglockhart psychiatrist William Rivers. Both works are to be commended, but they are essentially fictional accounts.</p>

<p>Part of the hospital’s plans to restore traumatised British officers to health was <a>to put these men to work</a> in the professions they knew. For Owen, this would include teaching English at Tynecastle High School, returning him to the reassuring rhythms of work routines.</p>

<h2>Capital interest</h2>

<p>This sparked my interest to find out more about Owen’s time in Edinburgh. Who did he meet, where did he go, what influenced him, what did he write? What started as amateur history research expanded, and now I chair <a href="http://www.napier.ac.uk/about-us/our-location/our-campuses/special-collections/outreach-and-events/wilfred-owens-edinburgh">Wilfred Owen’s Edinburgh 1917-2017</a>, a literary community celebrating the centenary of the poet’s time in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Looking at Owen through the lens of the city has led to a decade of research and thrown up some interesting questions. Not least about the meeting between Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon and <a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/robert-graves">Robert Graves</a>, who would be recorded in history as three of the greatest World War I poets.</p>

<figure class="align-left ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/177104/width237/file-20170706-31685-q3qke7.jpg">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Sassoon was also a patient at the hospital, and fellow officer Graves was a great friend who visited him in Edinburgh during his convalescence. The two would survive the war and write autobiographies of their experiences – Sassoon, <a href="https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571064106-memoirs-of-an-infantry-officer.html">Memoirs of An Infantry Officer</a>, and Graves, <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/57207/goodbye-to-all-that/">Goodbye To All That</a>. </p>

<h2>Finding Owen</h2>

<p>I was fascinated with this meeting. But one of the major challenges of researching Owen is that most of the archival material is held in the US. Early trips established the facts, but crucially, I was looking to identify the scene of the Edinburgh meeting in October where Owen, Sassoon and Robert Graves held what has been described as “<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-39567320">a powerful literary meeting</a>”.</p>

<p>Seeking this place compelled me to return to Owen’s letters <a href="http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00528">held at the University of Texas</a>. It was here I learned of <a href="http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/from-blunden-to-sassoon-with-gratitude/">a new publication</a>: Carol Rothkopf’s <a href="http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/from-blunden-to-sassoon-with-gratitude/">Selected Letters of Siegfried Sassoon and Edmund Blunden, 1919–1967</a> (2012).</p>

<p>Letters between the two men in 1936 spoke of the important Owen-Sassoon-Graves Edinburgh meeting on October 13, 1917. The venue was not revealed, but there was mention of a “2½ miles” distance to the place. So I got in my car and drove to Edinburgh to check it out. I had a hunch that the meeting took place at Baberton Golf Club on the west of Edinburgh – Oxford-based scholar and Owen biographer Dominic Hibberd first floated this suggestion in 2003, but it was never corroborated.</p>

<h2>A hole in one</h2>

<p>Returning to Edinburgh, I checked maps of the era again to confirm there was no other route between Craiglockhart War Hospital and Baberton Golf Club than the two roads which still exist today. Again I checked the distances. Both routes sat just outside the 2½ miles talked about in the 1936 letter. Another dead end. Then in February 2017 I went back over all the emails I had sent to archives about this historic poetic meeting, and finally everything fell into place.</p>

<p>Southern Illinois University held many of Sassoon’s letters from the Great War, and eight years after I had first been in touch, I renewed my quest, homing in on a specific letter between Sassoon and Graves. And there it was: Sassoon arranging to meet Graves at Baberton Golf Club, 2¾ miles from Craiglockhart Hospital. The venue was simply chosen because Sassoon had a golf tie that morning which he could not cancel, so he asked Owen to bring Graves to the club.</p>

<p>This meeting of arguably the greatest war poets of World War I happened only once. But clearly, Owen made an impact on Sassoon’s friend Graves, for he was invited to the young captain’s wedding the following January.</p>

<p>More importantly, the discussion between the three may also have been profoundly inspiring. Owen’s biographers, Dominic Hibberd and Jon Stallworthy, claimed that the friendship fostered with Sassoon at Craiglockhart <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wilfred-Owen-Biography-Dominic-Hibberd/dp/0753817098">accelerated Owen’s poetic development</a>. But this meeting at Baberton brought together three young poets deeply affected by their shared experience of war. The timing of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/poetryseason/poems/dulce_et_decorum_est.shtml"><em>Dulce et Decorum est</em></a>, Owen’s shocking poem about a <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/mustard-gas2.htm">gas attack</a> is not without significance; the 24-year-old officer <a href="http://www.wilfredowen.org.uk/poetry/dulce-et-decorum-est">wrote it</a> two days later. </p>

<p>The Shropshire lad then returned to France in 1918 and was killed one week before the <a href="http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-did-the-armistice-end-the-first-world-war">Armistice</a> on November 11.</p>

<p>Finding the place of this historic meeting adds another piece of information to our knowledge of the war poets’ Scottish enlightenment and to the history of the conflict. It also adds to the richness of Edinburgh’s literary heritage, to know that one of the most vivid and excoriating poems of World War I was written after three young soldiers met in the genteel confines of an Edinburgh golf club.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80229/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

This was an “authored” documentary by Italian journalist Annalisa Piras. Co-produced with several European partners, it examined growing political tensions across the Eurozone.</p>

<p>The documentary is intercut with dramatised material set in an imagined future following the collapse of the EU. Here, increasingly isolated nations are descending into chaos, terrorism and belligerent nationalism. The film unleashed a firestorm of criticism from powerfully <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2973924/BBC-s-apocalyptic-drama-tragedy-EU-break-condemned-scaremongering-propaganda.html">eurosceptic sections</a> of the British press, much of it centring on the apocalyptic images of the “disaster”.</p>

          </figure>

<p>Framing a study of the EU within a thriller raises a curious issue – the lack of engagement with European politics elsewhere in the rich tradition of British thrillers. The long-running spy series <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mf4b">Spooks</a>, for instance, frequently explored topics linked to the EU in popular imagination. These ranged from immigration tensions to corruption in global finance – yet Spooks generally avoided placing such issues in a European political context.</p>

<p>Similarly, there have been many conspiracy dramas with an international focus, including <a href="http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/473217/index.html">Edge of Darkness</a> (1985), <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/thestatewithin/">The State Within</a> (2006) and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01z78nq">The Honourable Woman</a> (2014). Yet these have again typically ignored Europe in favour of exploring tensions in the UK’s “special relationship” with the US.</p>

<p>This may seem a strange absence to note – it could be argued that the EU is too distant, bureaucratic or dull to offer obvious thriller material. Yet a more positive contemporary portrayal could be found in the 2015 transcontinental multilingual crime drama, <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-team">The Team</a>. This centred on the collaboration of national police agencies under the framework of Europol, mirroring how the series itself was a co-production involving multiple EU countries. Perhaps prophetically, however, Britain played no role in this vision of continental cooperation.</p>

<h2>Europe’s sinister power</h2>

<p>Britain did, nonetheless, have a much earlier tradition of thrillers engaged with the EU’s predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC). Yet these had typically viewed it in more paranoid terms.</p>

<p>In 1982, Ron Hutchinson’s television drama <a href="https://takingtheshortview.wordpress.com/2013/03/30/bird-of-prey-bbc-1982/">Bird of Prey</a> centred on hapless civil servant Henry Jay, who becomes embroiled in a sinister continental conspiracy after investigating the fraudulent activities of a European MP. The same year, Chris Mullin’s novel <a href="http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/articles/blog_paranoid_visions/">A Very British Coup</a> depicted a left-wing Labour party winning a surprise election victory whereupon its radical policies, including withdrawal from the EEC, spark a conspiracy among the right-wing establishment to bring down the government.</p>

<p>Nowadays euroscepticism is most strongly associated with the hard-right of British politics. Bird of Prey and A Very British Coup, by contrast, are more invested in left-wing anxieties of their era. This reflects how euroscepticism was initially more prominent within the labour movement and from politicians such as Tony Benn, who opposed the EEC’s enshrinement of market values.</p>

<figure>
            <iframe width="440" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQY2CHx4d3U?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            
          </figure>

<p>In A Very British Coup, withdrawal from the EEC is part of the radical government’s wider opposition to free markets. Indeed, the following year a strongly left-wing Labour party would in reality put EEC withdrawal in its <a href="http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/lab83.htm">1983 manifesto</a>.</p>

<p>Of these two thrillers, however, Bird of Prey is more directly engaged with European politics. Its central criminal conspiracy, Le Pouvoir (“The Power”), structured to enable financial corruption by politicians and businessmen, is explicitly linked to the ECC. As Jay states in the series: “The closer we get to them politically, socially, the more the system will be operated here.” The overarching scheme is for a sinister multinational based in Rome to create a privately operated Channel Tunnel. Through this they aim to monopolise transport in “Great Britain Ltd”.</p>

<h2>The ‘national us’</h2>

<p>The primary British conspirator is nationalistic security chief Charles Bridgnorth. He disparages the “bloody foreigners” he works alongside while passionately expounding on the scheme’s value to “the national us”. Otherwise, he declares: “The decline continues. Grass grows on the pavements. Sheep graze on the airport runways.  We’ll be the rumour of a thing that’s died.  Didn’t there used to be a country once called England?”</p>

<figure class="align-center ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/176887/width754/file-20170705-29998-d2s805.jpg">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Bridgnorth represents a tension in the project associated with the Conservative leadership of Margaret Thatcher – an awkward alliance between global finance and bellicose nationalism. Casting suspicion on both poles, the drama instead aligns its sympathies with the protagonist. A suburban-dwelling stamp collector, Jay embodies a cosy, insular Britishness untroubled by either nationalism or internationalism.</p>

<p>Two years later a sequel, Bird of Prey 2 (1984), saw Jay battle a new plot to corrupt a transcontinental electronic banking system. This time, however, the conspiracy is fully European. With no equivalent character to Bridgnorth, the Thatcherite rhetoric is absent. Indeed, over the course of the 1980s Thatcher herself, a one-time EEC supporter, was developing a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11598879">more hostile attitude</a> towards Europe.</p>

<p>Concurrently, euroscepticism softened on the left, as the EEC was increasingly seen as a bulwark against Thatcher’s assaults on areas such as workers’ rights. Notably when A Very British Coup was <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/a-very-british-coup">adapted for television</a> in 1988, the radical Labour government’s commitment to EEC withdrawal was significantly downplayed.</p>

<p>This may also account for the EU’s absence from later thrillers. Over subsequent decades, the hard-right nationalism of Bridgnorth has come to dominate the anti-Europe argument and drown out the leftist case. Yet perhaps of equal significance is the cosy insularity represented by Jay, epitomising a lack of positive or constructive engagements with Europe in British culture. In the end, this would prove the vacuum in which Bridgnorth’s perspective could thrive, embodied by the likes of Nigel Farage and UKIP.</p>

<p>El Sistema is a vast operation that brings hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan children, many of them ostensibly poor, under the umbrella of a classical orchestral training scheme in the name of their “salvation”. It has been covered extensively in the past decade, often by journalists who are given red-carpet tours and press office accounts and the success stories of individual musicians. This has all given the programme an unduly rosy international image, further distorted by a romanticised vision of the power of music.</p>

<p>However, recent studies by academics and researchers – <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/el-sistema-9780199341559?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;">myself included</a> – paint a rather different picture. They point to <a href="https://geoffbakermusic.wordpress.com/el-sistema-older-posts/idb-study-sheds-doubt-on-el-sistemas-claims-of-social-inclusion-and-transformation-short-version/">a high dropout rate and low poverty rate among the musicians</a>, limited evidence of social transformation, and various other systemic problems. But with journalists and others around the world now in thrall to El Sistema’s miraculous story, these inconvenient accounts are largely overlooked.</p>

<p>Instead, the Anglophone media in particular tends to stick to an idealised image of El Sistema that it began constructing around the time of the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra’s rapturously received <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/21/proms2007.proms">performance at the 2007 BBC Proms</a> in London. The programme began to be hailed globally as a “miracle”, a glorious project that transforms the lives of Venezuela’s poorest children through classical music.</p>

<p>And now, as the domestic political tensions around El Sistema dramatically increase, the same dynamic is playing out again.</p>

<h2>Looking away</h2>

<p>As Venezuela’s political crisis has deepened and its economy all but collapsed, dissatisfaction with the state-funded music program has surged. Many Venezuelans particularly resent its iconic figurehead, the conductor <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/gustavo-dudamel-i-thought-john-williams-was-joking-when-he-asked/">Gustavo Dudamel</a>, whose high public profile, warm relations with top government figures and long-term silence over the escalating civil strife have alienated many of his compatriots.</p>

<p>This is a significant narrative kink in one of classical music’s biggest stories – and yet it was barely covered by the usually attentive media. When a government minister was captured on camera telling El Sistema’s employees to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMjwXc7hwNy/">toe the party line or find a new job</a>, there was a furore online, but mainstream journalists looked away. </p>

<p>But then, two developments finally caught their attention. </p>

<p>First, Sistema musician <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-venezuela-protests/">Armando Cañizales</a> was killed in an anti-government protest on May 3 2017. Dudamel responded with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/gustavo-dudamel/levanto-mi-voz-i-raise-my-voice/10155493367329683/">statement on Facebook</a> criticising the government. Then a Sistema violinist, Wuilly Arteaga, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/528072958/tear-gas-doesnt-stop-venezuelan-protester-from-playing-the-violin">became a fixture</a> in the anti-government marches, playing his violin in front of lines of riot police. </p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, these developments were picked up by major outlets including the New York Times, which headlined a major feature story with the words <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/world/americas/venezuela-protests-musicians-nicolas-maduro.html?_r=1">Venezuela Musicians Rise Up</a>. </p>

<p>In a few strokes, the coverage shifted from blithe neglect to breathless over-dramatisation. Media reports around the world cast Dudamel as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/04/venezuela-gustavo-dudamel-attacks-maduro">heroic resistance figure</a> issuing a “fiery statement” and “denouncing” the government, failing to take account of his long history of silence and many Venezuelans’ deep scepticism about him. That scepticism seems to have been little moved by the Facebook post, which many – including members of Cañizales’s family – saw as <a href="https://van-us.atavist.com/too-little-too-late">too little, too late</a>. </p>

<p>Dudamel has since returned to his habitual silence, interspersed with the occasional platitude about peace and unity, undermining the notion that he was leading an uprising as opposed to simply managing his image. Arteaga, meanwhile, has now left Venezuela for the US, where he is enjoying his 15 minutes of fame on the Latino chat-show circuit.</p>

<h2>Business as usual</h2>

<p>After Cañizales’s death, <a href="http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/entretenimiento/musicos-del-sistema-protestaron-por-muerte-armando-canizales_180520">around 50 musicians</a> staged a protest outside the Sistema headquarters. The largest banner declared that “El Sistema cannot sound the same”. Yet with 827,000 musicians currently enrolled in El Sistema, according to official figures, a tiny one-off protest hardly amounts to a musicians’ uprising. What’s genuinely striking is that nearly two months after the protest, El Sistema in fact does sound the same.</p>

<p>It pays to think about what hasn’t happened. There has been no organised orchestral protest, no mass resignations, no refusal to go on the international tours that the government funds for propaganda purposes. No leading conductor or soloist has publicly resigned over the increasing use of Sistema orchestras for political ends. <a href="http://gustavodudamel.com/us-en/schedule">Dudamel’s schedule</a> continues to show overseas engagements with El Sistema’s top orchestras. </p>



<p>The isolated actions of a few individuals do not suggest that El Sistema is, as <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-venezuelan-governments-newest-opponent-is-a-state-funded-orchestra-79975">one writer</a> recently called it, “the Venezuelan government’s newest opponent”. With its near-monopoly on classical music in Venezuela, the program still exerts significant control over its musicians – and it remains firmly aligned with the regime. Some rank-and-file members might join the protesters, but its leaders <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BTkumM5gIAN/">march for the government</a>.</p>

<p>Cañizales died in an anti-government protest, but that doesn’t mean he is representative of hundreds of thousands of his fellow musicians. Indeed, Wuilly Arteaga, the now-famous violinist of the protests, left El Sistema before he emerged as an iconic musical hero; he has <a href="http://elcooperante.com/sin-pelos-en-la-lengua-wuilly-arteaga-revelo-los-vicios-politicos-dentro-de-el-sistema/">criticised his former colleagues</a> for their political complicity and hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The recent attempts to paint Dudamel and El Sistema as heroes of the resistance are simply the latest in a long line of romanticised misrepresentations. A more representative figure would be the first Sistema musician to become a cause célèbre in this year’s protests, horn-player <a href="http://www.univision.com/noticias/protestas/yo-soy-musico-los-gritos-de-un-joven-para-evitar-su-arresto-durante-una-protesta-en-venezuela">Frederick Chirino Pinto</a> – who made it clear he was not in fact joining in, but simply on his way to a rehearsal.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80500/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

In the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/21/golden-daze-50-years-on-from-summer-of-love-san-francisco-festivals">summer of 1967</a> a huge number of American teenagers – nobody knows exactly how many, but some estimate between 100,000 and 200,000 – escaped what they saw as their suburban prisons and made for the city district of Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco.</p>

<p>We now look back on the “Summer of Love” – the name originated at a meeting of counter-cultural leaders in the spring – as a lost golden age of bliss, excitement and adventure; a paradise which can never be recreated. But in actual fact, this centre-piece of the 60s still looms large over popular culture and social mores today.</p>

<p>Drawing on utopian traditions which <a href="http://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300136159/republic-mind-and-spirit">date back to the founding fathers</a>, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/07/what-inspired-the-summer-of-love/528675/">fuelled by</a> the euphoric and hallucinatory powers of marijuana and LSD, the summer of 1967 saw an extraordinary culture rise in a remarkably short space of time. </p>

<p>There was a creative explosion in the arts, music and fashion combined with a belief that the world could be born anew. Characterised by the vivid, flowing colours of psychedelic art, and a belief that love was the solution to all problems, hippy culture set out to transform the world by rejecting every social, political, economic and aesthetic feature of mainstream Western society. </p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/aug/21/san-francisco-exhibition-victoria-albert-revolution-silicon-valley">hippy revolution</a> became a media sensation with the release of Scott Mackenzie’s song, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/aug/20/scott-mckenzie-san-francisco-anthem">San Francisco</a>”, in May 1967, which was a huge hit in the US and much of Europe.</p>

<figure>
            <iframe width="440" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7I0vkKy504U?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            
          </figure>

<p>The story goes that a paradise of peace and love prevailed in San Francisco for much of the year, but came sadly unstuck very soon after. This new Garden of Eden was destroyed progressively by the sheer numbers of teenagers who descended on Haight-Ashbury. One leading figure described the resulting chaos as a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/21/golden-daze-50-years-on-from-summer-of-love-san-francisco-festivals">zoo</a>”.</p>

<p>Commercialisation of the hippie dream compounded the problem and disillusion set in. The twin shock of the <a href="https://singout.org/2015/08/10/death-valley-69-charles-manson-murdered-60s-part-one/3/">Manson murders</a> in August 1969, and the brutal killing by Hells Angels of an audience member at the <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-altamont-festival-brings-the-1960s-to-a-violent-end">Rolling Stones concert at Altamont</a> a few months later, provided the epitaph to an era.</p>

<p>According to this version, the “survivors” renounced psychedelia, abandoned the vain belief that love would solve everything and knuckled down to political action – gay liberation, second wave feminism and environmentalism. Or they found gurus and became new agers. The 60s were sealed off, preserved in aspic as a lost golden age, a time of innocence. It was over, finished, forbidden to anyone who wasn’t there.</p>

<p>However, like all golden age stories, this narrative is largely bogus.</p>

<h2>Happy together</h2>

<p>Criticism of the Summer of Love mythology dates back to 1967 itself, to the <a href="http://www.diggers.org/top_entry.htm">Diggers</a> – named after the <a href="http://www.diggers.org/english_diggers.htm">English radicals of 1649-50</a>. This guerrilla street theatre group regarded the hippy phenomenon as a media creation, a distraction from the true attempt to build a new and more just society. They denounced the irresponsible preaching of psychedelic guru <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPSzTBP5PAU">Timothy Leary</a>, who urged teenagers to take LSD and renounce work and education, and attacked the catchy nonsense of MacKenzie’s song as a marketing ploy.</p>

<figure>
            <iframe width="440" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPSzTBP5PAU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            
          </figure>

<p>The truth is that like all apparently simple cultural phenomena, the Summer of Love was complex. There was a deep tension between the Diggers’ back-to-basics idealistic communism, the commercialism of hippy capitalists selling bells and beads, the advocates of psychedelic transformation, and the politicos of the <a href="http://www.eiu.edu/historia/ruhaak%202003.pdf">new left based in Berkeley, California</a>.</p>

<p>The single issue all these groups opposed was <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/vietnam-war-protests">American involvement in Vietnam</a>. When the war came to an end with the Paris peace accord in 1973, there was no longer a binding external enemy. The illusion of a single, principled counterculture vanished.</p>

<h2>Flowers in your hair</h2>

<p>In reality, there was no single “60s”, no golden age, and nothing to come to an end. Instead there were three <a href="http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_chunk_g978140513199525_ss4-1">taste cultures</a> that all coincided, and started to change society’s values. </p>

<p>The first of these cultures was based in fashion and music. <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-peacock-revolution-1960s-menswear">Peacock styles for men</a> – long hair and bright colours – and women in mini-skirts or flowing hippy garb. The second group were political revolutionaries, post and neo-Marxists for whom the transformation of socio-economic conditions was the pressing priority. The third group believed in inner transformation and liberation achieved through marijuana and LSD. </p>

<p>Though the three groups’ priorities were fundamentally different, they shared a belief that the past was old and stale, along with a commitment to unfettered individualism. There were, of course, still significant overlaps, and when psychedelic culture met the radical left, notions of protest as play and performance took centre stage.</p>

<p>Half a century on from the height of the Summer of Love, all three taste cultures have survived, but with a different relevance. Individuality and self-expression in fashion and music has continued unhindered. Traditions of political protest flourish as new targets are found in environmental activism and sexual politics. And new generations of spiritual seekers find inspiration in psychedelic drugs, now also known as entheogens.</p>

<p>Defining the 60s as a single unique period, a lost golden age, seals it off from contemporary experience. The sun may have set on the Summer of Love, but the warmth of its rays are still being felt today.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/77212/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

It’s a debate that has raged since the middle of last century. In Philip Larkin’s day, the scholarly advocates of New Criticism felt that the text itself, regardless of authorial intent or audience affect, was <a href="http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/HSH/Whitec/terms/B/BiographFallacy.htm">all that really counted</a>. </p>

<p>But we’re surrounded by the <a href="http://narrative.georgetown.edu/wiki/index.php/Paratext">paratext</a> – material such as covers, blurbs, biographies and introductions, which surrounds any text. We’re steeped in literary knowledge impossible to ignore. Can we interpret the demise of Helen Burns in Jane Eyre without acknowledging the Brontës’ history of consumption? Can we read Keats in ignorance of his similar fate? And might we enjoy the poetry of Larkin innocent of any knowledge of the <a href="https://theconversation.com/after-years-of-scandal-philip-larkin-finally-has-a-spot-in-poets-corner-68527">poet’s outmoded beliefs?</a></p>

<p>The University of Hull has just launched a major exhibition charting Larkin’s life, as part of <a href="https://www.hull2017.co.uk/">Hull City of Culture 2017</a>. This retrospective offers a measure of the man: his Beatrix Potter porcelains jostle for attention with his Billy Bunter books and his records (Handel, Dylan, Bechet, Holiday and the rest). His neckties, tattered and stained sit alongside his Grim Reaper cufflinks and his RSPCA pin. His D.H. Lawrence mug and matching T-shirt (in its original cellophane), his unwrapped packs of Christmas cards, a paperweight, a commemorative plate, his jazz journals and jazz catalogues. And there are oh-so-many books: How to Avoid Matrimony, Martin Amis’s Money, the diaries of Samuel Pepys, the four slim volumes of his own verse – and hundreds more texts, battered but beloved. All brought together, for all the world to see, in the place he once worked, the detritus of a half-lived life.</p>

<p>The show’s curator Anna Farthing <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-40496677">told the BBC</a>: “It’s incredible that somebody who had such a contradictory and conflicted world and life managed to produce art that was so clean and clear.”</p>

<p>Larkin’s poetry, though avowedly lucid, remains complex and conflicted. His attitudes to race, for example, maintained a precarious suspension between an inherited xenophobia (his father was a Nazi sympathiser) and a love of jazz. In <a href="https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571134762-all-what-jazz.html">All What Jazz</a>, his collection of journalistic love-letters to the music which enriched his life, he supposed that slavery and segregation generated that music. The African-American, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7ZnWCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=did+not+have+the+blues+because+he+was+naturally+melancholy+%5Bbut%5D+because+he+was+cheated+and+bullied+and+starved&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xpUQ_Rv1ia&amp;sig=iyTntBKU8HylMvlmMnpD7yXOEXs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi67oPTsPLUAhWGAcAKHQQiAGMQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=did%20not%20have%20the%20blues%20because%20he%20was%20naturally%20melancholy%20%5Bbut%5D%20because%20he%20was%20cheated%20and%20bullied%20and%20starved&amp;f=false">wrote Larkin</a> “did not have the blues because he was naturally melancholy [but] because he was cheated and bullied and starved”. He warned that, if this oppression ended, its wonderful and strange fruit would perish too.</p>

<p>Larkin’s argument, though profoundly offensive, at least lacks hypocrisy. In his own life he appeared similarly determined to pursue (and enjoy) his miseries in order to provide an authentic foundation for the agonisingly slow processes of his art. This groundedness averted what he considered the pretensions of modernism. And so he was grudgingly content to spend 30 years running the university library at Hull – “it forces you to think about something other than yourself”, he told fellow poet John Betjeman in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coe11pgoj8E">1964 documentary</a>. It was good for him “as a poet”. </p>

<h2>Miserable old so-and-so</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.oatridge.co.uk/poems/p/philip-larkin-toads.php">Ten years earlier</a> he’d lamented having let that “toad work squat on [his] life”. But <a href="http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/philip_larkin/poems/14541">by 1962</a> he’d come to see those daily labours as conferring meaning upon his existence: “Give me your arm, old toad; Help me down Cemetery Road.” As Andrew Motion suggests in his <a href="https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571170654-philip-larkin-a-writers-life.html">biography of the poet</a>, Larkin seemed even to select his holiday destinations so as to enjoy own irritation at their discomforts and inconveniences: “As Larkin’s temper rose so his pleasure increased.”</p>

<p>But Larkin’s work (like Samuel Beckett’s) propagates redeeming ironies in its confrontations with the fear and loathing of everyday life, finding consolation in the commonality of its desperation, of that “<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48422/aubade-56d229a6e2f07">sure extinction that we travel to</a>”. We have far more in common than that which divides us. The value of this message is reinforced when echoed by this most unsentimental and divisive of literary voices: “<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47594/an-arundel-tomb">What will survive of us is love</a>.” </p>

<p>Larkin’s attitudes to women, meanwhile, seemed puerile, submissive, dismissive, adoring and sometimes aggressive. Yet he appears closer to Alfred Hitchcock than to Donald Trump. His work forces inner conflicts into the light of conscious scrutiny. It performs the opposite of the chauvinistic brag; he’s a constant voyeur, as once joyful and ashamed, into others’ sexual exploits: their “<a href="https://allpoetry.com/Annus-Mirabilis">brilliant breaking of the bank</a>” - “this,” <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48417/high-windows">he admits</a>, “is paradise”.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxxd3fbLgFs">Terry Eagleton</a> once denounced Larkin as a “miserable old so-and-so who raised boredom, emptiness and futility to a fine art”. Yet <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520032439">Eagleton</a> has also suggested that the progressive power of literature can run counter to the “overtly reactionary” intentions of its author. </p>

<p>Might we witness this in the fertile paradoxes which underpin Larkin’s verse? Might his playing out of such stresses illuminate contemporary cultural tensions? Such a re-revisionist approach might not only resurrect Larkin’s reputation, but see his work’s worth as founded upon its conflicted responses to his own hatreds and neuroses.</p>

<p>“Books are a load of crap”, <a href="https://allpoetry.com/A-Study-Of-Reading-Habits">Larkin wrote</a> in his all-deprecating way. Yet his work demonstrates that literature’s value may lie in this very crappiness. Great poetry can be conflicted and inconsistent, can (as <a href="http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/whitman/song.htm">American poet Walt Whitman</a> would say) contradict itself. The best sense, then, we may hope to find here would be just those words which are “<a href="https://allpoetry.com/Talking-In-Bed">not untrue and not unkind</a>”. That may not be much, but it may also be enough.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80561/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

            </span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Shutterstock</span></span></figcaption></figure><p>We seem to have always believed, dreamed and played with the idea of floating, somehow unsupported by very much. Utopian socialist architectural movements in Soviet Russia imagined vast levitating cities and housing blocks in direct contrast to their grounded, capitalist counterparts. In contrast, Jonathan Swift imagined the lodestone powered flying city of Laputa, directed and designed to assert power over earthly populations.</p>

<p>The floating, light and ethereal body is also a figure common to the spiritual (stories of ascension can be found in most religions) but also popular imagination – such as the ubiquitous superhero figures and earlier representations of science fiction. Dr Strange is lifted by his levitation cloak, Aladdin by his magic carpet and Superman hovers above and speaks down to terrestrial governments and their populations, performing sovereign acts outside of the rule of law and order. </p>

<p>Levitators in literature, cinema and popular culture commonly express yearnings for escape – in the 1985 classic film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/">Brazil</a>, Buttle (Jonathan Pryce) daydreams of winged flight to escape his administrative hell, for example.</p>

          </figure>

<p>Perhaps it seems natural to see levitation as a superfluity and less deserving of more weightier topics (note how we divide issues by senses of height and weight). But as I suggest in my <a href="http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/display.asp?ISB=9781780237374">new book</a>, levitation deserves much greater scrutiny as an important note in our scientific, cultural and spiritual imagination. More often than not, levitation tends to belie stark inequalities, various forms of violence (often upon women), and even oppression, sexualised exploitation and racism.</p>

<h2>The fat witch</h2>

<p>Female levitators are often maligned as ridiculous, dangerous characters, often by men. This is a very old trait, but was solidified and given shape by the influential Jesuit theologian Martin Delrio, who published <em>Disquisitiones magicae</em> (Magical Investigations) in 1599–1600. His book popularised the idea that demon spirits could posses or inhabit a female human body. It also suggested how to identify and track them. For the witch-hunters and storytellers of early modern Europe, the levitating, flying witch was a figure of grotesque femininity, and often portrayed as fat.</p>

<p>In a way, the relationship between the levity of witches and weight is central. It was the idea that witches were corpulent that made the idea of their flight seem so uncanny, so wrong. And of course, trial by ordeal – whereby it was “tested” whether a woman was a witch – was completed not so much by assessing the weight of a potential witch but by their buoyancy: flotation proved guilt.</p>

          </figure>

<p>The collusion between ideas of levitation with femininity, weight and gendered suspicion and exploitation have continued. We find many tales of levitation in the stories and investigations of Victorian mediums, a popular figure of attraction in the homes and domestic settings of the metropolitan middle classes in the late 19th century. As well as contacting the spirit world and exuding mysterious substances, many mediums claimed to, and were believed to, possess the power to levitate things and sometimes themselves. Mediums were also an object of considerable scrutiny for philosophers, physicists, psychical investigators, and sceptics.  </p>

<h2>Floating mediums</h2>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Figures such as the famous Mrs Guppy and the Italian medium Eusapia Palladino stand out. Mrs Guppy <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/148533594">ignited middle-class intrigue</a> in the wake of a tale of her transportation and levitation from a friend’s home in Highgate to Lamb’s Conduit Street in Holborn on June 3 1871. Palladino, on the other hand, held many sittings – some of which were conducted under scientific observation and measurement – where she purportedly levitated various tables and objects, much to the amazement of audience members, who ranged from Marie Curie to the the racial criminologist Cesare Lombroso.</p>

<p>Guppy and Palladino became highly sexualised figures. Both were taunted and ridiculed for being fat. Many newspaper characterisations of Guppy’s flight played upon the size and weight of her body, repeating some of the tropes of fatness and supernatural flight associated with the witch we found above. Weight and lightness were a prime object for satire, making her levitation seem somehow more absurd, while hinting at her apparent low class, low morals and yearning for both sex and ascendance. Sex and flight are common pairs as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/11/stranger-magic-marina-warner-review">Freud would try to make clear</a> – he was also afraid of flying.</p>

<p>For women, levitation has tended to be viewed as an affliction, as a fraudulent power and diminishing of class or status, or as the supernatural puppetry of a male protagonist pulling the strings. Men hardly ever levitate in the same way, appearing to be far more wilful, assertive and domineering – or simply close to god, as the many religious tales of <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-and-general-terms/religion-general/levitation">levitating saints</a> attest.</p>

<h2>Feminist reclamation</h2>

<p>More recently, there have been efforts to try to reclaim the female levitator from an object of male desire, control or exploitation. Mid 20th-century surrealist friends Remedios Varo and Leonora Carrington (who was <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/04/leonora-carringtons-adventures-in-surrealism/">expelled from a convent school</a> for her rebellious behaviour: attempting to levitate was one of them) used magic and levitation in their works to unsettle the status quo. Their magical landscapes featured women in the position of scientists, explorers and magicians, floating things or themselves.</p>

<p>Female levitation has also been used to enliven some pithy social commentary. In The Kármán Line (2014), a short BAFTA nominated film by Oscar Sharp, Olivia Colman is ever so slowly lifted off the ground in a form of “magical social realism”. She eventually crosses the Kármán Line boundary – the line between earth and space where the atmosphere becomes too thin to support heavier than air flight. The film is a commentary on family detachment and figurative estrangement to the slow loss of a woman from the home. Her slow rise through the house and into the sky stretches and collapses conjugal, motherly, familial and terrestrial attachments. The film is incredibly sad, but is also a story of hope, of coming to terms with – and living on after – a drawn-out death.</p>

          </figure>

<p>These stories of levitation – and the parallel histories of human flight – are not as light as we might have thought. This history demonstrates that what often seems like an escape is usually more plainly an expression of oppression and powerlessness. But these stories need to be re-examined – and the female levitator potentially reclaimed.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80217/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

Despite his worldwide reputation as the creator of nightmare futures, many people are unaware of Burgess’s credentials as an outspoken opponent of literary censorship. </p>

<p>From the beginning, his career as a novelist was plagued by legal difficulties. The second volume of his Malayan trilogy, The Enemy in the Blanket (published by William Heinemann in 1958), was the subject of a <a href="http://self.gutenberg.org/articles/eng/The_Enemy_in_the_Blanket">successful claim for libel</a> in the High Court in Singapore. The judgement was overturned on appeal, but Burgess gained a reputation for being troublesome. Matters were not improved when another novel, The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/16/rare-copy-anthony-burgess-novel-lawsuit-the-worm-and-the-ring">Worm and the Ring</a>, was also judged to be libellous in 1962.

          </figure>

<p>This was the context in which Burgess became a champion of free expression. When, in the early 1960s, his friend William Burroughs was having trouble finding a British publisher for his scandalous novel The Naked Lunch, Burgess wrote a letter to the Times Literary Supplement (published 2 January 1964) promoting Burroughs and his work, and another article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/20/william-burroughs-naked-lunch-review-anthony-burgess-1964">published in the Manchester Guardian</a>. Among the novel’s detractors was <a href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/my_nose_nailed_to_other_peoples_lavatories_edith_sitwell_on_naked_lunch">Dame Edith Sitwell</a>, who wrote to the TLS, saying: “I do not wish to spend the rest of my life with my nose nailed to other people’s lavatories.”</p>

<p>In 1966 Burgess gave evidence on behalf of Hubert Selby, whose novel, Last Exit to Brooklyn, was the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3625500/Culture-quake-Last-Exit-to-Brooklyn.html">subject of an obscenity trial</a>. When the novel was eventually acquitted in 1968, Burgess wrote an <a href="http://www.letterpressproject.co.uk/inspiring-older-readers/2016-07-20/last-exit-to-brooklyn">introduction to the first post-trial edition</a>, in which he defended Selby’s writing on the grounds of literary merit. Reflecting on the Selby case in the 1990s, Burgess admitted that he had exaggerated the literary qualities of Last Exit to Brooklyn in order to thwart the guardians of public morals who had wanted to see it banned. He maintained that the deception had been worthwhile.</p>

<h2>Harassed in Malta</h2>

<p>Burgess embroiled himself in another controversy shortly after the Moors Murders trial, in which it was revealed that Ian Brady had owned a collection of books including erotic novels and a biography of the Marquis de Sade. Pamela Hansford Johnson wrote about the trial in a <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9145167?selectedversion=NBD684897">non-fiction book</a> called On Iniquity: Some Personal Reflections Arising Out of the Moors Murder Trial (1967). Johnson quoted Burgess on free expression and attacked him as a “rhetorical poseur”.</p>

<p>Burgess’s response was swift and robust. In an article titled <a href="http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/1st-december-1967/11/what-is-pornography-books">What Is Pornography?</a> he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any book can be used as a pornographic instrument, even a great work of literature, if the mind that so uses it is off balance. I once found a small boy masturbating in the presence of the Victorian steel-engravings in a family Bible […] Ban the Marquis de Sade and you will also have to ban the Bible.</p>

          </figure>

<p>Having established his anti-censorship credentials, Burgess moved to Malta with his wife and son in 1968. Shortly after arriving on the island, he discovered that a large chunk of his personal library had been impounded by the Office of State Censorship. The list of confiscated items included books by D.H Lawrence, Angela Carter and Kingsley Amis. When the Sunday Times sent a copy of Doris Lessing’s Children of Violence for review, this was also confiscated by the censors, presumably because of its inflammatory communist and feminist content.</p>

<p>Enraged by the climate of censorship in Malta, Burgess decided to open up the subject for debate. He gave a lecture at the University of Malta titled “Obscenity and the Arts”, in which he argued that the suppression of literature on ideological or religious grounds was intolerable in a modern liberal society. When Burgess left Malta to visit his wife’s family in Italy, he returned to find that his house had been confiscated by the vengeful Maltese government. He managed to get it back, but only after he had leaked the story to The Guardian and the New York Times.</p>

<h2>Burning books</h2>

<p>Living in Rome in the mid-1970s, Burgess decided to translate the obscene and blasphemous sonnets of the 19th-century Roman dialect poet Belli, who had worked as a Vatican censor by day and secretly written more than 3000 offensive poems, unpublished in his lifetime. Burgess translated Belli into defiantly colloquial English, taking care to preserve the tone of the original poems:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know the day, the month, even the year.<br>
While Mary ate her noonday plate of soup,<br>
The Angel Gabriel, like a heaven-hurled loop,<br>
Was bowing towards her through the atmosphere.<br>
He crashed a window. Mary, without fear,<br>
Saw him come through the hole in one swift swoop.<br>
A lily in his fist, his wings adroop,<br>
‘Ave,’ he said, and after that, ‘Maria.</p>

<p>Rejoice, because the Lord’s eternal love<br>
Has made you pregnant — not by orthodox<br>
Methods, of course. The Pentecostal dove<br>
Came silently and nested in your box.’<br>
‘A hen?’ she blushed. ‘For I know nothing of –’<br>
The angel nodded, knowing she meant cocks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later this year, the Manchester-based Pariah Press will reissue Obscenity and the Arts in a new edition, featuring responses to Burgess’s text by Germaine Greer and contemporary visual artists. </p>

<p>This publication promises to bring his various writings about censorship back into focus, and to animate new debates about a subject which has never gone away. </p>

<p>As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of Burgess’s birth, it’s worth asking what he would have thought of Charlie Hebdo, or modern-day erotica such as Fifty Shades of Grey. It’s more than likely that he would have quoted one of his favourite lines from the <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005852">German poet Heinrich Heine</a>, which Burgess himself translated thus: “Whoever burns books will be burning people next.”</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80089/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

          <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Like Paddington, his creator Michael Bond was a polymath. A BBC cameraman, script-writer and radio buff, Bond quite liked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/28/michael-bond-obituary">being a writer</a>, and inquisitiveness was a characteristic he passed on to Paddington. Troubles befall the bear which are inadvertently caused by his own stubborn curiosity and determination to try new things. </p>

<p>Despite his simply lovable exterior, Paddington is complex. He wants to be useful and “grown up”, yet desperately desires a quintessential British childhood. He is both a foster bear who effortlessly plays the part of the new child in the nuclear family, and an immigrant. In both roles he is a wide-eyed tourist in post-war London <em>and</em> a guest who has to prove himself worthy of his hosts. His stories engage with questions of social integration as well as offering witty commentary on domestic life. </p>

<p>The child “played” by the animal (in order to avoid the expectation that he will grow up and leave the comfortable Brown family) is also the social outsider. It is this dual identity that makes Paddington distinctive.</p>

<p>His stories have plenty of features which set them apart from other books about talking animals. One key element is that the books are set in the big city of London, rather than the lush rural locations of Wind in the Willows or The Tales of Winnie-the-Pooh, or the imaginary landscape of Alice in Wonderland. </p>

<p>Paddington is part of the modern human world. His bear characteristics are reduced to a restricted (if inappropriate) diet, the annoyance of having fur (especially when close to cream buns) and a lack of respect for neighbourly boundaries. </p>

<p>His experiences present us with a sharply drawn slice of 20th-century middle-class life. The Browns take Paddington to a department store, to restaurants, and on holiday. Unlike another classic of this period, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25027090">The Tiger Who Came to Tea</a>, the exotic animal character becomes part of the family – and part of English society. </p>

          </figure>

<p>The books might even be said to communicate anxieties about that society’s loss of imperial prestige. Bond originally described the bear as being from “darkest Africa” and changed the location to Peru only when his editor pointed out that bears are extinct in Africa. </p>

<p>This adjustment for the sake of accuracy (in a book about a bear who eats Marmalade sandwiches and wears clothes) makes more sense when seen as both an implicit recognition of colonial anxiety and a reference to the post-war commitment of helping refugees and those displaced from their homes. In the late 1950s many African nations (including Kenya and Uganda) were fighting for independence from European rule, while Commonwealth citizens were unhappy with the lack of recognition given to their wartime efforts on behalf of Britain. </p>

<p>Britain’s loss of influence through the <a href="https://theconversation.com/suez-crisis-shows-what-happens-when-friends-dont-share-65844">Suez Crisis</a> in 1956 meant the dissolution of most colonies in the early 1960s seemed inevitable. I am not suggesting that Bond had geopolitics in mind when writing these stories. But had Paddington been from Africa, a place with deep historical links to the UK through colonialism, his baggage might have been heavier and posed a greater risk to the comfort of Bond’s readers.</p>

<h2>A very wise bear</h2>

<p>The books are, after all, keen to show the benefits of humanitarian commitment. Bond was inspired to give Paddington his label and suitcase by images of child evacuees leaving London to escape the Blitz. The character of Mr Gruber is a Hungarian immigrant whose alliance with Paddington suggests the author’s enthusiasm for a cosmopolitan Britain in which difference is valued.</p>

<p>After travelling all the way from Peru in a lifeboat, Paddington is clearly in need of assistance, yet he is neither displaced from his home by violence or persecution, nor in possession of a valid visa. According to current immigration laws, he would be sent back to Peru. Perhaps I am reading too much into this favourite children’s book. But Michael Bond’s subtlety as a writer allows us to do exactly this without denying the appeal of (and nostalgia for) the easily mended mishaps of childhood. </p>

<p>For Paddington, things work out even when his situation appears precarious. His adventures bring him into contact with all kinds of social, technological and political changes, including the interest in spying and undercover detective work that came with the Cold War and appears in Paddington Turns Detective in which he investigates the disappearance of a prize marrow. </p>

<p>Yet Paddington doesn’t worry about the future – he trusts in the safety of the present. He’s settled into his new home – far from his arbitrary origins in Peru, but being well looked after and with much to offer his new generations of young fans.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80408/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

The detective finally made his debut that November in the Beeton’s Christmas Annual – the story narrated as always by his faithful assistant Dr John Watson. </p>

<p>Long before any mention of the deerstalker, pipe or magnifying glass, Watson informed us of Holmes’s love of his violin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That he could play [violin] pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn’s Lieder, and other favourites. </p>

<p>When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognised air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We later discover in <a href="https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php?title=The_Adventure_of_the_Cardboard_Box">The Adventure of the Cardboard Box (1893)</a> that this violin is a Stradivari, the Italian hallmark of violin perfection. Few readers will have thought this more than a pleasing additional dimension to Holmes’s more famous characteristics. I believe it is much more than that. </p>

<p>Doyle may have been using this violin to give us a vital clue to the enigmatic character of Baker Street’s most famous resident. If so, it has gone unnoticed for 130 years. Let me lay out the case one step at a time.  </p>

<h2>Fiddles and forgeries</h2>

<p>The piano and the violin both rapidly grew in popularity in the Victorian era. No craftsman was more famous than Antonio Stradivari of Cremona (Stradivarius is the Latinised name that usually appears on the labels). Along with other great Italian names such as Amati and Guarneri, these fabulous instruments became much sought after. </p>

<figure class="align-right zoomable">
            <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/176640/area14mp/file-20170703-16961-je4vhm.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/176640/width237/file-20170703-16961-je4vhm.jpg"></a>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>In many cases, however, the violins were not real. Forgers took advantage of people’s ignorance, conning those seeking the finest old Italian violins by creating cheap factory-built instruments and labelling them as masterpieces. </p>

<p>One notorious example was the case of <a href="https://archive.org/details/hodgesagainstch00hodggoog">Hodges vs Chanot of 1882</a>, which exposed Georges Chanot as falsely presenting a violin as having the Carlo Bergonzi imprint. It was popular in the press and well known to the general public.   </p>

<p>Many of these forgeries are still with us today. Walk into most local auction houses in the UK and I guarantee you will find at least one old Victorian violin, strings broken and looking a bit sorry for itself. Inside will be a label for Antonio Stradivarius or another old Italian maker. Buyers will be left in no doubt that it is a fake rather than a fortune.  </p>

<h2>Context, dear chap</h2>

<p>Academics and fans have done much work into tracing the origins of Doyle’s stories and characters. We <a href="https://museum.rcsed.ac.uk/the-collection/key-collections/key-object-page/arthur-conan-doyles-letter">know</a> Holmes was partly modelled on Joseph Bell, a surgeon and medical lecturer whom Doyle would have known as a student at the University of Edinburgh. </p>

<p>We <a href="http://www.sherlock-holmes.org.uk/conan-doyle/">know</a> he was influenced by the Victorian public appetite for true crime and detective fiction. We see, for example, the hand of <a href="https://jamesmclevy.com">James McLevy</a>, Edinburgh’s first police detective. </p>

<p>McLevy published a series of incredibly popular true-crime books in the 1860s based on cases he worked on. The way he consulted medics and scientists at the University of Edinburgh seeking new ways of solving new crimes in an age before forensics is very similar to Holmes’s near-forensic approach to detection. </p>

<p>Also exceptionally popular was <a href="https://www.birlinn.co.uk/The-McGovan-Casebook-9781841830506.html">James McGovan</a>. McGovan too appeared to be a detective who had investigated the streets of Edinburgh. It only later came to light that the books were fiction, written by a well known Edinburgh violinist named William Crawford Honeyman. </p>

<p>The McGovan books came out between 1878 and 1884, which heavily overlaps with Doyle’s own time in the city (1876 to 1881). This makes it highly probable that Doyle was familiar with the series at the very least. </p>

<h2>The Real Cremona</h2>

<p>The final McGovan book is <a href="https://archive.org/details/tracedtrackedorm00mgovrich">Traced and Tracked, or, A Memoire of a City Detective (1884)</a>. It includes a short tale called The Romance of a Real Cremona, about McGovan’s investigation of the theft of a Stradivari from a stately home near Edinburgh. During the investigation, McGovan interviews the owner, a Mr Cleffton, and asks about the value:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Worth £400 – refused £200 for it the other day, [Cleffton] continued […]</p>

<p>"£400!” I echoed. “Is it possible you gave that sum for a fiddle?”</p>

<p>“No, not quite so much, but that’s its value,” he slowly admitted.</p>

<p>“How much did it cost you?”</p>

<p>“£40”, he rather reluctantly answered.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Watson tells a similar story about Holmes in The Adventure of the Cardboard Box. He talks about how the detective had “purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at least five hundred guineas, at a Jew broker’s in Tottenham Court Road for fifty-five shillings”. Note that both instruments were bought for significantly less than their supposed value.</p>

<p>Another similarity is that in both stories, the violins passed through the hands of a pawnbroker. In real life, it was very common for fake instruments to move through pawnbrokers as a way of removing the identity of the forger or reseller. </p>

<p>In the Real Cremona, McGovan visits a Mr Turner, an “eccentric connoisseur” who “had a craze for buying fiddles which he never did, and never could, play upon”. In Doyle’s <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/73/be/bb/73bebb7cbeb73e8a92dcbd6fb0236f7b.jpg">original sketched notes</a> for his detective, Holmes was to be a collector of rare violins. </p>

<p>This never made it into the books in the end, yet it does say in <a href="https://sherlock-holm.es/stories/pdf/a4/1-sided/stud.pdf">A Study in Scarlet</a> that Holmes “prattled away about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati”. Certainly, he demonstrated the same Victorian collector’s enthusiasm as Mr Turner.</p>

<p>The language that describes playing the violin is also comparable. In the Real Cremona, Cleffton comments that “some of the servants may have taken it [the stolen violin] out to have a scrape”, and that the violin was of no use to another character “for he is only a wretched scraper”. In A Study in Scarlet, Watson talks about how Holmes would “scrape carelessly at the fiddle”. </p>

<p>To be sure, scraping violins appear elsewhere in Victorian literature. But it is one more unmistakeable similarity with Honeyman, and at the very least illustrates how Doyle was steeped in the same Victorian context. </p>

<p>Finally, it is worth bearing in mind that the McLevy story came out in 1884. This was two years after <a href="https://archive.org/details/hodgesagainstch00hodggoog">Hughes v Chanot</a> and various other documented suspicions around classified Stradivari adverts that appeared around the same time. </p>

<p>As a violinist himself, Honeyman would have been particularly familiar with these cases. Indeed, in his <a href="https://archive.org/details/violinhowtochoos00hone">later writings</a> on the violin, he tells a story of a violin bought for £22 by an unwitting gentleman, dreaming it would be worth £1,000, but was actually worth no more than £5. </p>

<h2>Case closed?</h2>

<p>In short, the very strong implication in both the Real Cremona and the Doyle books is that the Stradivaris are not genuine. They are products of the Victorian forgery trade. </p>

<p>Which begs the question: if Doyle deliberately wrote this detail into the Holmes books, what was he trying to say about him? Perhaps it points to the detective as a flawed protagonist, cutting through his greatness at solving crimes to remind us he was not infallible. </p>

<p>Every time Holmes puffed his pipe and explained to Watson who the culprit was, there appears to have been one unsolved case under his nose that he didn’t even know about. Perhaps Doyle was laughing about it quietly to himself until his own death some 40 years later.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80360/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

I’ve always seen art as the converse – as something unquantifiable and fundamentally opposite to science.</p>

<p>But a recent collaboration with Hannah Imlach, an artist-in-residence here at Heriot-Watt University, has caused a dramatic change in my opinion, making it clear to me that science and art are inherently interconnected and that science can learn much from the world of art.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.microscopy.co.za/what-is-microscopy">Microscopy</a> is one of the highest-impact innovations in the history of science. With origins in the 1600s and the earliest parts of the <a href="https://explorable.com/science-and-enlightenment">scientific age of enlightenment</a>, microscopy has evolved to underpin almost all aspects of modern science. The largest impact is arguably in the life sciences, where the ability to observe the complex, transient and dynamic world of the single cell has revolutionised healthcare, quality of life and fundamental understanding.</p>

<p>Today’s microscopes include Nobel Prize-winning <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/physics/microscopes/fluorescence/">fluorescence</a> and <a href="http://jcs.biologists.org/content/124/10/1607">super-resolution</a> techniques which together have pushed microscopy into a new era, allowing us to see more detail than ever before. We can study highly specific parts of the living cell in real time and create computer models of this activity. We have reached the stage of being able to offer a direct and measurable description of the cellular world.</p>

<p>Within the complex world of the cellular microscopist, the essence of the microscope is often lost, the amazing beauty and elegance of the technology overlooked. Sometimes it is important to step back and take stock of what the imaging delivers. As scientists we focus on the all-important push to quantify data, often forgetting to ask ourselves what it is, in fact, we see when we look through the eyepiece.</p>

<h2>Common ground</h2>

<p>The Institute of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Bio-engineering at Heriot-Watt University was awarded a <a href="https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/news/archive/awards-focus-archive/artist-residence-grants">Leverhulme Artist in Residence</a> grant that allowed Hannah Imlach, a visual artist working primarily in sculpture, to work and study within our institute for a year. By fully immersing herself in our research environment, Hannah could shadow researchers and seek inspiration for new works that reflected the modern research and applications of microscopy.</p>

<p>A scientist collaborating with an artist seems a challenging idea. Interdisciplinary science and communication are central to modern science – and deservedly so – but the boundary between art and science is somewhat unbridged. Where do you begin – and where is the common ground?</p>

<p>To start, both scientist and artist shared a passion for observing the visual beauty of cells that are seen down a microscope. As the art was to be functional and sculptural, there was shared excitement in building prototype optical systems. These included various projection systems and large microscopes, all designed to merge the microscopy instrumentation with an artistic vision of the data being studied.</p>

<p>However, true overlap between the scientific and artistic process came in an entirely unexpected way, when the artist showed her sketchbooks to the scientists.</p>

<p>These were lovingly referred to as “lab books” by the scientists, and visually documented every thought and process being explored as the concepts and ideas formulated themselves into understanding and eventually structure. This was a developmental and thought process with direct parallels to the scientific method – and it led to a profound realisation on my part.</p>

<h2>Head and heart</h2>

<p>Whereas scientists may document their results and meticulously record and detail the analysis and discussions, they rarely do the same for setting out their ideas. It’s “all up here in my head” and rough paper and temporary whiteboard sketches often suffice. In this project, the artistic idea was laid bare and what was clear that within it was the very essence of how a scientific idea is born and brought to fruition.</p>

<p>In the same way, both scientist and artist follow a shared methodology: the first hypothesis, the uses of the base knowledge, abandoned ideas, initial results, interpreting them and developing them – all before evolving into the final experiment and results.</p>

<p>The so-called artistic process, seemingly uncoordinated and disorganised, mirrors the scientific process, only in this case it was more elegantly drawn and documented. It became clear that science and art can be the same – and that ultimately they are based on thoughts, ideas and passion. It’s only how we end up formulating those ideas and presenting our conclusions that actually differs.</p>

<p>Hannah’s piece, Fluorescence Projector, allows the viewer to fully immerse themselves in the world of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. It projects real data through a water-filled ball lens, inspired by the early 1600s microscopes, and reformulates the image into a floor projection screen. By intentionally allowing optical aberration and vibration to impart themselves on the sculpture, the viewer can interact and seek depth within the projected data.</p>

<p>This has left me asking the question: how do we process scientific observations? How do we develop our ideas, and transfer these to experiment, to understanding and then disseminate? These are simple questions, but ones that need to be considered.</p>

<p>The truth is it’s a messy process, fluid and interpretive. It requires intuition and hunches, but most importantly, inspiration and a connection to the work that runs deeper than textbook understanding. Put simply, it’s artistic, and for me, the scientist, it took working directly with an artist to see just that.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80244/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

Again. Hollywood’s determination to put marauding mummies in our sights suggests we still haven’t reached “peak curse”, almost a century after the <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)13576-3/fulltext">sudden death of Lord Carnarvon</a> made headlines.</p>

<p>So why was the idea of ill-fated Egyptology so alluring in the 1920s, when Carnarvon and Howard Carter found Tutankhamun’s tomb – and why does it keep returning to haunt us? One answer is that our obsessions are never really about the ancient past. They arise from the perspective people develop at a given moment, as they use the ancient past to express their own anxieties – and aspirations. </p>

<p>The 1920s offers a case in point, as I explore in my <a href="http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/display.asp?ISB=9781780237268">new book</a>. At the same time the treasures of Tutankhamun and the curse of the pharaohs caught the imagination of mainstream culture, two modernist movements (Pharaonism in Egypt, the Harlem Renaissance in America) were interpreting ancient Egypt in a very different way. To them, ancient Egypt was an inspiration to take seriously, not turn into a fun, or a fright, show.</p>

<h2>King Tut</h2>

<p>In November 1922, backed by the Earl of Carnarvon, Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun in Luxor’s Valley of the Kings. To the British press, it was the first positive news from Egypt in years. (Egypt had been a difficult “veiled protectorate” since 1882, and earlier in 1922 Britain had decided to let Egypt elect its own government while keeping hold of foreign affairs and the Suez Canal.) And so the world went mad for “King Tut”, as he was quickly dubbed. </p>

<figure class="align-center ">

<p>In England and America, popular songs, stage shows, and fashion design all celebrated Tutankhamun, as did advertising for everything from biscuits to cigarettes. There were Tut-themed balls in New York, student hi-jinks at Cambridge University, and a life-size recreation of the tomb’s antechamber built for the British Empire Exhibition in 1924 and seen by more than 27m people at Wembley Stadium, which was built for the purpose.</p>

<p>Call it Tut-mania, as many people do, but there was a certain method beneath the madness. The more King Tut could be treated as “one of us”, with “us” being white Euro-Americans, the more it seemed like he belonged to “us”, too, along with the rest of ancient Egypt. What better way to make a claim on culture than commodify it? Even news coverage and photographs of the tomb were for sale: Carnarvon gave The Times (of London) exclusive access to the find in return for a share of its profits. That riled other news outlets – including the thriving Egyptian press, suddenly banned from reporting a discovery in its own back yard.</p>

<h2>Other Egypts</h2>

<p>But neither Carnarvon nor Carter had thought about how much this rare find – the only royal burial discovered more or less intact – would mean to modern Egyptians. Poets and playwrights lauded the resurrection of Tutankhamun, comparing it to the rebirth of Egypt itself after centuries of slumber. The movement for an independent Egypt went hand-in-hand with an artistic and literary movement known as <a href="http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.5743/cairo/9789774166891.003.0004">Pharaonism</a> (<em>Fir‘awniyya</em>). No one could dispute the might of the Egyptian pharaohs. Rulers such as Ramses or Cleopatra, plus symbols such as sphinxes and pyramids, were harnessed to express the ambitions of the new state – and the antiquity of its roots.</p>

<p>Nobel prize-winning novelist Naguib Mahfouz, who had witnessed street uprisings against Britain in his childhood (and visited the Cairo Museum), used ancient Egyptian themes in his first novels, while the Paris-trained sculptor Mahmoud Mukhtar raised public subscriptions for his colossal sculpture <em>“Nahdet Misr”,</em> “Egypt’s Renaissance”. Carved, like the lid of Tutankhamun’s sarcophagus, out of red granite from Aswan, the sculpture pairs a sphinx and an idealised image of Egyptian womanhood. It now stands outside <a href="http://cu.edu.eg/Home">Cairo University</a> – an institution whose founding the British administration had opposed.</p>

<p>The antiquity and independence of ancient Egypt spoke to other 1920s cultural movements, too – including the group of African-American writers and artists known as the Harlem Renaissance. “Egypt” and “Ethiopia” were both synonymous with an Africa free of European control: Egypt because of its ancient history, and Ethiopia because it had fought off an Italian invasion in 1896. </p>

<p>“<a href="http://collections.si.edu/search/tag/tagDoc.htm?recordID=nmaahc_2013.242.1&amp;hlterm=Fuller+Meta+Vaux+Warrick">Ethiopia Awakening</a>” was the title of an Egyptian-themed statue by Philadelphia-born Meta Warwick Fuller, who had studied with Rodin in Paris. It represents a woman with a beatific expression, black physiognomy, and a pharaonic head-scarf, unwinding herself from the constraints of mummy bandages. Cast in bronze, the statue featured in the “Colored Section” of the America’s Making Exposition in New York in 1921, organised to celebrate immigration. Although African-Americans had been forced migrants in slavery, organiser WEB DuBois saw a chance for the exposition to promote their contribution to the US. Meta Warwick Fuller turned a mummy into a force for good: there is no curse or vengeance in her Ethiopia sculpture, just freedom – or the longing for it.</p>

<h2>Egyptomania</h2>

<p>We admire the 1920s as the Jazz Age, an era when what we think of as modern Western mores sprang from the ruins of war. But what looks more sophisticated in retrospect: Britain’s imperial adoption of Egyptology and the Western commercial mania for mummies and King Tut, or the creative output ancient Egypt inspired in Egyptians and African-Americans, in the same decade? </p>

<p>“Ethiopia Awakening” looked to a future based on dignity and equality, as did <em>“Nahdet Misr”</em> – while the British Empire Exhibition, with its Tutankhamun replicas, looked to the rapidly setting sun of British imperialism. Perhaps any curse in Carnarvon’s untimely death wasn’t from what he and Carter discovered, but what they overlooked – that theirs was not the only “ancient Egypt” out there. </p>

<p>It’s a useful caution that we should look for the method that might lie behind any Egyptomania today, whether that entails movie franchises or museum displays. Turning sacred objects (which is what mummies were, to the people who made them) into light entertainment hardly flatters any of us. Nor does imagining the Middle East as an origin-place for horror and a threat to white masculinity, this time in the guise of Tom Cruise. If we are doomed to rehashing The Mummy, in other words, it’s a curse not of Egypt’s making – but ours.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/79519/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

But Michael Bond’s Paddington was born into a world torn to pieces by a destructive conflict. His story is that of the refugee – and it remains as relevant today as it was when Bond, who died aged 91 on June 27, created him in the 1950s.</p>

<p>Paddington comes out of a certain kind of war trauma. Newsreel footage of the Nazis moving people out of their homes in the 1930s stuck with Bond: “Footage of elderly people pushing prams with all their belongings in them. Refugees are the saddest sight; I still think that,” <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11247595/Michael-Bond-I-was-worried-that-Id-let-Paddington-down....html">Bond said</a> in 2014 – just as his creation was about to reach a new generation with a big-screen adaption.</p>

<p>There had been no shortage of trauma for Bond himself. He left school very young and was 17 when he volunteered for aircrew service in the RAF. He joined up after surviving a serious bombing raid in Reading that killed many of the people working in his building. But flying didn’t agree with him – so, after suffering chronic airsickness, he moved to the Middlesex regiment of the British Army. Still a child himself, the war transformed him and perhaps also globalised him, pushing back the borders of his vision of the world to encompass other places and peoples. For, although he sets his Paddington stories in a safe middle-class house in West London, Paddington himself comes from elsewhere, somewhere so far-flung to be the other side of the world – “Darkest Peru”.</p>

<h2>The stowaway and his label</h2>

<p>As a stowaway Paddington travelled illegally by boat and was taken in by comfortably off London family. But the bear’s famous label is also very important, signalling his role as a figure for a series of memories about the trauma of World War II. Bond recalled watching images of evacuee and refugee children <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/michael-bond-interview-modern-world-depressing-paddington-escape/">wearing labels at train stations</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Living in Reading during the war, I can remember train-loads of refugees coming down from London. A lot of the children had luggage labels round their necks with their names and addresses on them. It made a great impression on me; seeing these lost, frightened people. I felt it would say a lot about the Brown family that they were prepared to take in a refugee like Paddington.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bond bears witness to experiences of the huge number of people displaced by the war and of refugees and migrants in the post-war era who combine to create a sympathetic character in Paddington and a strong ethical message in Bond’s writing of the value of hospitality. </p>

<p>At the time of writing the first Paddington book in 1962, Bond lived in a flat on Portobello Road with his first wife, not in the large middle-class house with housekeeper that he imagined for the book. This part of west London was a key site of immigration, its cosmopolitan population associated with the arrival of Caribbean workers in the post-war era and refugees from across Europe. </p>

<p>Paddington’s great ally, Mr Gruber, runs an antique shop there – this character was based on his literary agent Harvey Unna, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11247595/Michael-Bond-I-was-worried-that-Id-let-Paddington-down....html">Bond said</a> that his main complaint about the film adaptation of Paddington was he wanted someone foreign to play Gruber, “because he was based on my first agent, a lovely man, a German Jew, who was in line to be the youngest judge in Germany, when he was warned his name was on a list, so he got out and came to England with just a suitcase and £25 to his name”.</p>

<p>Mr Gruber is tolerant and hospitable, educated and a guardian of all that is precious and beautiful from the past. And as an older more experienced refugee, he plays a valuable role in signposting for Paddington the way to negotiate a safe place in an alien culture and how to cope with the trauma of uprooting and remaking “the self”. It is this vulnerability, moved from fiction to reality, that the playwright <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/28/michael-bond-and-paddington-offered-lessons-in-kindness-for-today">Michael Morpurgo</a> believes makes the Paddington story powerful to this day. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We only have to see that bear to see the predicament of a Syrian child. The Brown family adopted him, it was a messy adoption but it gave the bear a home. It delivers a very strong message about how we’ve grown away from the kindness to which we once aspired.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bond’s own commitment to refugees continued until his death.  He led a campaign – along with more than 60 children’s authors and illustrators – to highlight the government’s continued detention of hundreds of child asylum-seekers in prison-like conditions. Paddington himself forwarded <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/stop-abusing-child-refugees-says-illegal-immigrant-from-darkest-peru-1839868.html">a personal message</a> to the children at Yarl’s Wood Immigration Removal Centre in 2009. Paddington said their plight reminded him how lucky he was to be living at number 32 Windsor Gardens “with such nice people”. </p>

<p>Generations of readers have stood in Paddington’s shoes. Maybe that was Bond’s greatest gift to us. He encouraged us not to see refugees as scary “others” – but as people who may just appreciate a warm hug and a marmalade sandwich.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80284/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

One of these trailblazing self-portraits has just been <a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2017/contemporary-art-evening-auction-l17022/lot.10.html">sold at a Sotheby’s auction</a> for just over £6m. </p>

<p>These selfies perfectly suited Warhol’s vision of the pop art era of the late 1950s and 1960s – they are quintessentially all-American, democratic and mechanical. Though photobooth pictures could not go viral like social media pictures can now, the use of a photobooth to make art was, in 1963, fiercely innovative and added to the aura of technical invention that surrounded Warhol, just like it surrounds selfies and social media now.</p>

<p>Selfies are the holy grail of social media: self-portraying photographs that are posted on a social networking site and tell stories that aim to engage large numbers of people. <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=2638273">Our latest research</a> has revealed three things that can help you to take pictures that are worth – if not millions of pounds – at least a thousand words, and without you having to <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-do-people-risk-their-lives-or-the-lives-of-others-for-the-perfect-selfie-55937">risk your life</a> for them. </p>

<p>Our team conducted three experiments online with workers from <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> which crowdsources expertise in a range of fields, one with students on computers in our university laboratory, and one corpus analysis – a method of looking at a body of evidence collectively – with independent coders. To determine exactly what people engage with when they look at pictures online, we showed participants different images. They rated these pictures on a number of photographic elements: point of view, content, “artsiness” and the like. They also indicated how likely they were to comment on the pictures if they saw them on social media.</p>

<p>These studies made it possible to isolate the things that cause people to stop caring about an online image – and to find pictures that engage them. Not only that, but they also helped to determine the sort of pictures on which people are most likely to comment. So here are three things that enthusiastic selfie-portrait artists need to know.</p>

<h2>1. People prefer you in front of the camera</h2>

<p>Point of view (POV) in photography is a question of who it is people “see” taking the picture. The simple distinction is that of “person” – of which there are two principle kinds: third person (Warhol taking a picture of Marilyn Monroe, for example) and first person (Warhol’s selfie). In Warhol’s time, most photographs were taken from a third person point of view. But this has changed – our research does not find much enthusiasm for third person pictures in the social media age.</p>

<figure class="align-center ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/176216/width754/file-20170629-11766-erp1vw.jpg">
            <figcaption>
              <span class="caption">Warhol’s Marilyn: one of the most famous pop art images of all time.</span>
              <span class="attribution"><span class="source">faber1893 via Shutterstock</span></span>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Point of view contributes richly to how people feel and think as they look at a  picture. Just as the point of view can be from someone within or outside of the picture, so people pick up different feelings and thoughts. Warhol plays a greater part in the pictured story of his selfie than in his famous picture of Marilyn Monroe. Just as Warhol is more involved in the story he is telling with his selfie, so are other people statistically more likely to engage with the content of selfies.</p>

<h2>2. People get bored of just you</h2>

<p>Ever since the portrait was first invented, painters and photographers have tended to give priority of importance to person or action. Most people’s selfies are all about themselves – but our research suggests this is a poor strategy for attracting attention, as people are 15.14% more likely to comment on selfies of people doing something meaningful than on “just” selfies. </p>

<figure class="align-center ">
            <img alt="" src="https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/176223/width754/file-20170629-2697-1m11tvb.jpg">
            <figcaption>
              <span class="caption">How to get likes: do something interesting.</span>
              <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Mauricio Graiki via Shutterstock</span></span>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Selfie-takers have agency beyond just being the subject of their own pictures: they do things such as eating a bread roll, drinking from a bottle, waving their free hand. Warhol does something else, too – he appears to adjust his tie. Conversely, as Warhol does that, he necessarily reveals who he is: an icon of the golden era of pop art and the ultimate arbiter of celebrity glamour. By his action, other people come to know him better. They can like or dislike, react or respond to his picture. But he has captured their attention.</p>

<h2>3. Realistic pictures put people off</h2>

<p>Warhol’s selfie was designed not to portray or expose truth, but instead to acknowledge the artifice and deception inherent to any form of representation. If the creative leeway between reality and picture was wide in Warhol’s photograph, it is enormous since photography entered social media. This is necessarily the case. Photographers who complain that selfies are poor representations of reality, miss the fact that taking selfies is not representation in anything but the loosest sense. In fact, our research shows that not altering pictures can wind up in failure.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
            <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Kennedy2/status/863069572324356097"></a>
           </blockquote>
          <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>An adaptation can be serious or silly, amateurish or professional, and so on. Contemporary photographers should deploy the full power of techniques, such as emojis, filters, lenses – and tools such as “selfie sticks” to turn the original into something artful. Those selfies are superior in terms of engagement. We found that people are 11.86% more likely to comment on adapted selfies.</p>

<p>As people become increasingly sophisticated in their choice of pictures, it pays to become more people-centric and to think harder about the value a picture offers the audience rather than just yourself. The result will be a transformed selfie of you doing something – a picture that is worth a thousand words. Warhol <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol">wrote</a> in 1968 that, “In the future everyone will be world famous for 15 minutes.” That future is now.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/78050/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

This on the day that the opposition leader addressed more than 100,000 people from the festival’s main Pyramid stage.</p>

<p>“Channel 4 has a duty to be impartial. So how can it employ Jon ‘Fuck the Tories’ Snow?” demanded Quentin Letts in the Daily Mail, while his colleague Isabel Oakeshott took to Twitter to make the same point.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
            <a href="https://twitter.com/IsabelOakeshott/status/879683078070861824"></a>

<p>Simply by Googling “Jon Snow Tory remarks Glastonbury”, it appears that Snow is being widely reviled for his alleged anti-Conservative statements. He is accused of showing clear bias, something that – as a prominent journalist working for a publicly funded broadcaster – doesn’t look good. After all, Channel 4 is supposed to be strictly impartial, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Snow subsequently <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jon-snow-channel-4-newsglastonbury_uk_59525ea3e4b02734df2d5f0f">told the Huffington Post</a> that he had “no recollection of what was chanted, sung or who I took over 1,000 selfies with”. But whether or not he said what he is alleged to have said, the storm surrounding the claim raises some interesting and important questions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/18/-sp-bbc-report-facts-impartial">principle of impartiality</a> has been at the heart of public service broadcasting in the UK since the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1231593.stm">launch of the BBC in 1922</a>. The impartiality was to act as a check on the possibility that broadcasting – given its power to reach mass audiences – might, at some point, be used by a government to sway opinion in favour of its people and policies.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/">Office of Communications (Ofcom)</a> is at present the regulator charged with ensuring that “news, in whatever form, is reported with due accuracy and presented with due impartiality”. When it comes to its journalistic activities, <a href="http://www.channel4.com/producers-handbook/ofcom-broadcasting-code/due-impartiality-due-accuracy-and-undue-prominence-of-views-and-opinions">Channel 4 News journalists are bound</a> by the same Ofcom rules that apply for the news operations of the BBC. Namely:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reporting must be duly impartial, programmes or clearly-linked programmes must include and give due weight to an appropriately wide range of significant views and views and facts must not be misrepresented. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ofcom can impose sanctions, including fines, for breaches of impartiality. But an alleged case like Jon Snow’s would likely be excluded, given that his anti-Tory remarks took place outside the context of his employer’s programming. </p>

<h2>Fair and balanced</h2>

<p>The ideal of impartiality in journalism has a variety of siblings in terms such as fairness, balance, neutrality and objectivity – and various codes followed by established news organisations around the world pay at least lip service to these ideals. But more recently the rise of blogs and social media has meant that for some time now audiences have been able to customise their intake of news content and political commentary.</p>

<p>People have therefore become more likely to consume journalism that resembles their life experiences and points of view. A lot of work has been done about the way this encourages individuals to live in news “bubbles”. When presented with information contrary to their beliefs, they are also likely to harden their views – even when these are based on <a href="http://timharford.com/2017/03/the-problem-with-facts/">demonstrably erroneous</a> information and clear <a href="https://points.datasociety.net/fake-news-is-not-the-problem-f00ec8cdfcb">attempts to mislead and disinform</a>. </p>

<p>No wonder then that <a href="https://firstdraftnews.com/fake-news-complicated/">developments such as fake news</a> and the politics of controversy stoked by politicians such as Donald Trump and the champions of Brexit in the UK, are now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/business/balance-fairness-and-a-proudly-provocative-presidential-candidate.html">exposing the unsuitability</a> of traditional journalistic norms.</p>

<h2>Objectivity is a red herring</h2>

<p>While news organisations and experts <a href="https://www.diigo.com/user/squarsifa/b/384355522">struggle to solve</a> the challenge of what US academic Danah Boyd describes as <a href="https://points.datasociety.net/hacking-the-attention-economy-9fa1daca7a37">the hacking of the attention economy</a>, the discussion about partiality may be tackled from the more obvious premise that such values as neutrality and objectivity are a red herring.</p>

<p>To find common ground on the paradigms of journalistic practice, one would do well to draw on Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/29/society">The Elements of Journalism</a>, a book published in 2003 based on 21 public forums and interviews with more than 300 journalists.</p>

<p><a href="http://niemanreports.org/tag/the-elements-of-journalism/">Summarised here</a>, the authors conclude that objectivity was not so much a condition to be embodied by journalists – but by their methods for news gathering and their transparency regarding questions about how and/or from whom they obtained their information.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether it is secrecy or inability, the failure by journalists to articulate what they do leaves citizens all the more suspicious that the press is either deluding itself or hiding something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which brings us back to Jon Snow. His views have long been known to skew on the side of progressive or “left-wing” politics and have often fuelled debate, like when <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/1.615200">he expressed his views</a>  against Israel’s bombing of Gaza in Palestine or when he became involved in an experiment to demonstrate the effects of cannabis on the brain, which was said, at the time, to be “<a href="http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/17/jon-snow-gets-high-for-a-channel-4-documentary-is-very-jon-snow-about-it-5067206/">very Jon Snow</a>”.</p>

<p>And let’s face it, if Snow is a spin doctor for any particular political stance, he is not a very serious one. His contention that he has “no recollection” of the incident makes it all too easy for his critics to dismiss him as less than serious, or say that – at 69 – he is well past the age of retirement. </p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, Snow’s transparency about his politics suggests that the criticisms of what he may or may not have said at Glastonbury are just standard politicking. And there’s nothing impartial about that.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80246/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

            </span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Lionsgate</span></span></figcaption></figure><p>Another big-screen celebration of the man <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2509465.stm">frequently voted</a> the “greatest Briton” is currently greeting cinema goers. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2674454/">Churchill (2017)</a> tells the story of the war leader as he tussles with his subordinates during the final preparations for D-Day in June 1944. The film certainly has its charms, but do we really need yet another version of “Winnie the War Hero”? </p>

<p>For some, the answer is clearly an emphatic yes – and depictions of Britain’s “finest hour” are understandably reassuring for some in Brexit Britain. Put it this way – the UK left Europe after Dunkirk in 1940 with their tails between their legs, seemingly defeated by superior German forces, before returning triumphantly in 1944 (with a bit of help from their allies). Seen in this context, such films as Their Finest (2016), Dunkirk (due for release in July 2017), and Churchill offer attractive historical visions of resilience, resolution and transatlantic comradeship.</p>

<p>Indeed, Churchill, with Brian Cox in the title role, is only the first of two cinematic portrayals of the cigar-smoking warrior to be released this year. The second – <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4555426/">Darkest Hour</a> starring Gary Oldman, is due in November. In portraying the curmudgeonly war leader, Cox and Oldman join a veritable cinematic who’s who, most recently including Albert Finney (The Gathering Storm, 2002), Brendan Gleeson (Into the Storm, 2009), Michael Gambon (Churchill’s Secret, 2016) and John Lithgow (in The Crown, 2016). </p>

<figure>
            <iframe width="440" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dLl5qfNhBjc?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            
          </figure>

<p>But where Finney’s Churchill was portrayed as being ignored and isolated during the wilderness years of the 1930s – and where Lithgow’s brandy-drinking bathtub raconteur is seen negotiating the changed global order of the 1950s, the latest depiction of Churchill takes us back to 1944. As such, the film offers a rather different take on the great war leader of popular memory. </p>

<h2>Isolated and frustrated</h2>

<p>The film’s focus is revealed in the opening scenes which see Churchill wandering a windswept beach, alone. As he looks to the shoreline his mind and memory return to a past amphibious invasion for which he was partly responsible – the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00qt53k">Gallipoli landings</a>. The disaster which followed this 1915 assault on the Dardenelles clearly still weighs heavily on Churchill in 1944. And so there, on the foreshore, as he contemplates the D-Day operation, the sea runs blood red. </p>

<p>This nightmare of Allied destruction and defeat prompts a series of increasingly desperate attempts by Churchill to redirect Anglo-American strategy. Adamant that his instinct remains right, Churchill deploys all his charm, oratory and obstinacy to disrupt D-Day plans. In doing so, he comes into conflict with his leading generals, including Field-Marshal Montgomery – but most importantly the Allied supreme commander, General Dwight D “Ike” Eisenhower. </p>

<p>These encounters reveal that Churchill’s cherished status as strategic genius is suffering in the face of growing complaints that he no longer understands the details and demands of modern conflict. At one point, terrified that the Allied army will bleed out on the beaches of Normandy, he orders up alternative plans. But the Allied military is no longer his to command – chief of the British General Staff, Field Marshal Alan Brooke countermands his orders, while his efforts to force the cancellation of Operation Overlord are ignored by an increasingly irritated Eisenhower.</p>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

<h2>Too often elevated</h2>

<p>The film thus offers a commendable critique of a man too often elevated to the status of military demi-god in Britain. Better, surely, to see our heroes as humans – with all the flaws and failings that are their gift and burden. But, like any film, there is also much that it omits or overlooks.</p>

<p>So for all the distraught pleas to Ike to spare the lives of his soldiers, we should also acknowledge that this “humane” Churchill was still the very same man who authorised the area bombing of Germany (a policy, admittedly, which he <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11410633/Dresden-was-a-civilian-town-with-no-military-significance.-Why-did-we-burn-its-people.html">later found deeply troubling</a>). Similarly, this guilt-laden apologist for past military disaster was also the same man whose <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Churchill_s_Secret_War.html?id=Mir6v_OhJRUC">role in the Bengal Famine</a> of 1943 has long been criticised, most recently (and controversially) by journalist <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Madhusree+Mukerjee&amp;oq=Madhusree+Mukerjee&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1999j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Madhusree Mukerjee</a>.</p>

<p>Haunted by Gallipoli, yes. Desperate to avoid the mistakes of the armchair generals of 1916, certainly. Humane to his core, no. And nor should we expect anything different. As Carlo D’Este <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Warlord.html?id=78BLlwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">has argued</a>, Churchill was always a soldier, always a warlord, always a defender of the British Empire. These nuances, contradictions and complexities of character are absent, unfortunately, from the latest film. </p>

<p>But such quibbles are secondary to a more significant issue concerning the film’s overall focus. Where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/23/their-finest-review-big-hearted-second-world-war-drama-gemma-arterton">Their Finest</a> follows a young Welsh woman (Gemma Arterton) negotiating the misogyny of the wartime film industry as she strives to pen an inspiring story of the “people’s war”, Churchill returns the heroics to its all too usual place: Winnie, Monty, Ike. Little space here for the valour of the common man – and even less for that of the common woman (apart from one scene where Churchill’s young typist checks a moment of prime ministerial despair). This is Downton does D-Day. </p>

<p>Even Churchill’s wife Clementine (Miranda Richardson) remains in the wings. Over the past 40 years Clemmie – just like Churchill – has been played by a succession of greats, and Richardson’s performance is, as usual, compelling. Now and then we see the interventions of an increasingly exhausted Clemmie as she endeavours to control, contain and censor the words and actions of her husband. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, the result is that Clemmie remains peripheral, stoically enduring. Oh, to have Clemmie front and centre for once. Winnie was great, that is a tale long told.

            </span> <span class="attribution"><span class="source">Netflix</span></span></figcaption></figure><p>What if we could meet the challenges of the ongoing environmental crisis without changing our behaviour and practices in any way? What if, rather than revising our way of life, we could instead propose a few technical fixes that would reduce our environmental impacts while allowing us to go on living as before? Would this really settle the ethical and political questions that are posed by our current moment of climate catastrophe, mass extinction, resource scarcity and industrialised animal slaughter? These are some of the questions that are posed by Netflix’s latest original movie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjCebKn4iic">Okja</a>.</p>

<p>The story centres on the eponymous Okja, an animal belonging to a new species that has been genetically engineered to fulfil the developed world’s boundless appetite for meat, while minimising the environmental impact of its production. In the words of CEO Lucy Mirando (played by the always wonderful Tilda Swinton):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This beautiful and special little creature will be a revolution in the livestock industry. Our super pigs will not only be big and beautiful; they will also leave a minimal footprint on the environment, consume less feed, and produce less excretions; and most importantly – they need to taste fucking good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The film follows Okja and her young keeper Mija as agribusiness interests compete with animal activists to decide her fate.</p>

<p>Okja is a timely intervention into debates about the environmental costs of meat production. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet">For some years now</a>, the United Nations has been suggesting that we need to cut back on meat and dairy production for the sake of the planet – and, more recently, the wildly successful activist documentary <a href="http://www.cowspiracy.com/">Cowspiracy</a> brought this argument to a wider public. </p>

<p>As a consequence, there has been a recognition that livestock production needs to make a case for itself in terms that are <a href="http://www.beefmagazine.com/blog/my-response-cowspiracy-8-ways-cattle-grazing-supports-wildlife">more compatible</a> with recent environmentalist thinking – often by drawing on emerging technologies to reduce environmental impact. </p>

<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/11/scientists-might-reprogram-cow-guts-cattle-burp-less/">adjustments to cows’ gut flora</a> were proposed as a way to cut methane emissions. More radically, new developments in tissue engineering promise to bypass the living animal altogether by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/05/world-first-synthetic-hamburger-mouth-feel">growing real animal flesh</a> through cell culture in the laboratory.</p>

          </figure>

<p>Okja deftly satirises this turn from shameless profiteering to an (at least ostensibly) ethically and environmentally responsible agribusiness. Swinton’s CEO is more Steve Jobs than Henry Ford – and her vision for agribusiness owes more to tech-industry utopianism than it does to 20th-century industrial capitalism. Having wrested control of the company from her father (who developed military technology) and her sister (whose tenure as CEO was marred by industrial-ecological catastrophe), Mirando aims to turn “the most hated agrochemical company in the world” into a seemingly beneficent force for good.</p>

<h2>Killer question</h2>

<p>But in creating Okja’s species as an ecologically sustainable alternative to cattle, has Mirando finally reconciled animal agriculture to its ethical and environmental obligations? Animal activists in the film – and in wider society – would strenuously disagree. It’s worth noting here that the director is sympathetic to these claims, having <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/2017/06/okja-bong-joon-ho-vegan-1201839076/">become vegan</a> during the filming of Okja – and having borrowed much of the film’s visual rhetoric from footage taken by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TFdHAnpTYI">undercover activist documentarians</a>. In order to settle this question, we need to more carefully explore how sustainability functions as an ethical and political ideal.</p>

<p>Sustainability is a deeply ambivalent concept. On the one hand, it names a broad desire to take more responsibility for our impact on the planet – and this is clearly a good thing. On the other hand, unless it is directed by an ethical analysis which isn’t easily reduced to technical tinkering, it can quickly become a kind of cynical calculation. In this context, consider the strange paradox of new, more sustainable fishing practices: we save species from extinction in order to better kill them in the future.</p>

<figure>
            <iframe width="440" height="260" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nV04zyfLyN4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            
          </figure>

<p>The shift to thinking about the sustainability of meat production in merely technical terms (“how should we reduce emissions?”) entirely bypasses the question of animal ethics. Instead of asking “should we kill?”, we find ourselves asking “how should we kill with maximum efficiency?” By translating an ethical question into a technical one, this model of sustainability lets animal agriculture off the hook for the violence that it does.</p>

<p>Okja pushes back against this by foregrounding the relationship between a little girl and her animal friend. So, yes, Okja is a well-engineered beast who contributes to lower environmental impact, but she’s also an individual animal who loves and is loved – and she has an ethically significant interest in her own well-being. </p>

<p>As Okja and Cowspiracy make clear, the technical debate into the environmental impact of eating meat is critically important. But even if animal agribusiness could be made thoroughly sustainable, routine practices of confinement, forcible reproduction and slaughter remain highly ethically questionable.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80088/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

You only have to glance around on trains, in the street, or in cafes to see how increasingly lost we are in screen time. We don’t just hold our phones, we cradle them. </p>

<p>It is ten years since the iPhone’s release to the general public. And so now seems a perfect time to reconsider our love of technology.</p>

<p>I’m fascinated by our relationship with mobile phones, both past and present. Nokia has recently released <a href="https://theconversation.com/nokias-revised-3310-mobile-phone-is-the-latest-tech-to-target-retro-adopters-72270?sr=2">a new version of the classic Nokia 3310</a>. Originally launched in 2000, it was the company’s most successful phone, selling over <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/nokia-3310-review-2017-specs-uk-release-date">126 million units</a>. This technology nostalgia speaks of simpler times when a phone was a phone, not a computer; when we weren’t tethered to our workplace. A time when we met the gaze of others rather than the ever constant glow of our interactive screens.  </p>

<p>Our phones track, trace and archive our lives almost seamlessly. We’re leaving increasingly complex trails of messages, updates and other bits of our life stories online. We have access to a seemingly infinite archive of our emotional pasts. </p>

<p>As <a href="https://theconversation.com/im-moving-to-spain-now-online-memoirs-are-being-created-from-life-defining-texts-25063?sr=1">I’ve written previously</a>, this is something that I am particularly aware of. One morning I found an old Nokia at the back of a kitchen drawer, and scrolling through its inbox I realised I’d unwittingly archived a three-year text message dialogue between my son’s father and me: a relationship that unfolded in just 100 texts and told the story of how we met, dated for just a few months, broke up and subsequently dealt with an unplanned pregnancy. His last and final text message read: “I’m Moving to Spain.”</p>

          </figure>

<p>I recently bought this story to life in <a href="https://vimeo.com/189536800">160 Characters</a>, a smartphone short I filmed and directed for <a href="http://filmlondon.org.uk/160-characters">Film London</a>. It is currently <a href="https://www.picturehouses.com/cinema/Crouch_End_Picturehouse/film/docheads-the-past-in-the-present">playing at Picturehouse Cinemas</a> across London. The film explores the consequences of our access to our past. It aims to capture the challenges and limitations of early digital dialogues, to explore the space between words, the pauses, the moments in which I struggled to compress big emotions into what was then a 160 character message limit.</p>

<p>My own text message thread was just 100 texts, sent over three years. Now, my teenage niece can send 100 texts before lunchtime, on a phone that enables her to share these dialogues with the rest of the world. And so I decided to use my iPhone as a tool to explore the present as well as the past. I shot all the contemporary sequences on my iPhone 6, filming at the London locations where I sent or received the original text thread. Stories and relationships that were originally mediated through mobile phones were bought to life using the latest in smartphone production techniques.</p>

<p>The digital traces we leave behind us create a wealth of data about our lives, an ever evolving archive which creates a map of where we’ve been and where we’re going. Over the last decade many directors and artists have attempted to capture the emotional subtext of mobile phone dialogues, to convert the vernacular of digital dialogues and interactive screens into great drama. When writing a screenplay, once hidden text messages can reveal the secret lives of the central characters.</p>

<p>This has resulted in an evolving genre of films, TV and artworks which reflect our ever changing relationship to technology. The BBC series <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-secret-to-sherlocks-success-at-the-emmys-30947">Sherlock</a> and Charlie Brooker’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/">Black Mirror</a> are just two obvious examples of the ways in which cinema and TV have been influenced by the aesthetics and affordances of mobile media. The other night I enjoyed two such dramas back to back: BBC drama documentary <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08w29jm">Theresa vs Boris: How May became PM</a> and Channel 4’s <a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/ackley-bridge">Ackley Bridge</a>, which both featured text dialogues between the central characters. </p>

<p>There are also some interesting and experimental shorts that have evolved from this genre, such as Patrick Cederberg and Walter Woodman’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/65935223">Noah</a> or Trim Lamda’s <a href="https://www.shortoftheweek.com/2017/02/11/cracked-screen-snapchat-story/">Cracked Screen: A Snapchat Story</a></p>

<p>Our mobile phone has become like a time machine: it connects us with our past, our present and our future. The past is always with us, in the phones we cradle. The digital traces we leave behind us create a wealth of data about our lives, an archive of stories which artists and filmmakers will continue to capture and preserve. </p>

<p>We’re at the dawn of a new genre of technological storytelling which will continue to explore how we can collect, curate and share stories from our digital past. As technology continues to evolve, so too will representations of the increasingly complex ways in which emotions and technology converge.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/80208/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />

While the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39857543">investigation stalled</a> almost as quickly as it began, it was by no means the only occasion or high-profile matter of this type in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Discussing blasphemy feels anachronistic – something out of the middle ages. But it has recently been an issue as far away as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/09/the-guardian-view-on-blasphemy-in-indonesia-exploiting-religion-for-political-purposes">Indonesia</a> and as close as <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/don-t-blame-christians-for-the-stephen-fry-blasphemy-nonsense-1.3079537">Ireland</a>. W H Auden <a href="http://southerncrossreview.org/44/auden-eiseley.htm">once observed</a> that “one can only blaspheme if one believes”, but accusations of blasphemy have mainly been levelled against people who don’t share the same faith as the accusers. </p>

<p>Blasphemy charges are often used to express genuine religious outrage – but unproven allegations are also used for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/pakistans-blasphemy-laws-colossal-absurdity">political or personal ends</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/pakistans-blasphemy-laws-colossal-absurdity">persecute minorities or settle vendettas</a>. </p>

<p>In the UK, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HFZTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA927&amp;lpg=PA927&amp;dq=thomas+aikenhead&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AvIEX-pNSR&amp;sig=IcPkZ-0Hy07nfDwdLZhTCh1_Tfc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4meTEi9zUAhWIExoKHfNEAuU4HhDoAQg3MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20aikenhead&amp;f=false">Thomas Aikenhead</a> was hanged for it in 1697, while <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3753408.stm">John William Gott</a> was the last to be imprisoned for the offence in 1922 – for publishing tracts on birth control and likening Jesus to a clown.</p>

<p>Such activity clashes with traditional notions of freedom of religion and freedom of speech. As John Roberts, the chief justice of the US Supreme Court argued in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/562/09-751/opinion.html">Snyder v Phelps (2011)</a> in 2011:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and … inflict great pain. … we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a nation we have chosen a different course – to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even in some countries that pride themselves on their ability to openly discuss matters publicly, the topic is coming up more frequently.  </p>

<h2>Religious politics</h2>

<p>The subject is not uncommon in many countries that are avowedly religious and where the state would be expected to take such claims seriously. In Pakistan, for example, accusations of blasphemy have resulted in deaths from mob violence. Pakistan’s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, intervened in April 2017 after the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39610175">killing of Mashal Khan</a>, a university student accused of posting blasphemous messages on social media. </p>

<p>“The nation should stand united to condemn this crime and to promote tolerance and rule of law in society,” he said. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding Sharif’s warning, a mob stormed a police station a couple of weeks later in an attempt to lynch a Hindu man charged with blasphemy. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/04/10-year-old-boy-killed-attempted-blasphemy-lynching-pakistan">10-year-old boy was killed</a> in the violence and several adults were injured. The mob was reportedly led by an influential cleric as well as Zia Shehzad, a politician from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League political party, giving the incident both religious and political overtones.</p>

<p>In March, the governor of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama – a Christian in this majority Muslim nation – was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/09/jakarta-governor-ahok-found-guilty-of-blasphemy-jailed-for-two-years">successfully convicted</a> of blasphemy in a trial which raised a counter accusation of “<a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/12/06/expediting-of-ahoks-case-indicates-trial-by-mob-setara.html">trial by mob</a>” by the Setara Institute, a Jakarta-based rights group. “Ahok”, as he is known, will spend the next two years in jail.  </p>

<p>These recent occurrences raise concerns regarding religious tolerance and pluralism in modern society. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/mar/25/blasphemy-law-ad-hoc-committee">Representations have been made</a> by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to the United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Council between 1999 and 2010, proposing resolutions relating to “defamation of religion”. These have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/mar/25/blasphemy-law-ad-hoc-committee">condemned by opponents</a> who believe they aim to create a sort of international blasphemy law that may lead to domestic laws being passed.</p>

<p><a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/05/25/the-islamic-world-has-a-blasphemy-problem/">Krithika Varagur</a>, an American journalist living and working in Indonesia, has identified a spike in blasphemy charges over the past decade, especially in Indonesia where there is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/world/asia/indonesia-governor-ahok-basuki-tjahaja-purnama-blasphemy-islam.html">near nil chance of acquittal</a>. This is not isolated to Indonesia, she says – it’s becoming more common across the Muslim world. Some of this she suggests can be attributed to local circumstances – such as unrest in Egypt since the removal of the former president, Hosni Mubarak. </p>

<h2>In the West</h2>

<p>Accusations of this sort are less common in Western countries, which was what made the accusation against Fry remarkable. In May, <a href="https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2017/0506/873060-stephen-fry/">Irish police investigated a complaint that he had blasphemed</a> while being interviewed on RTE, the state broadcaster, about what he might say if he met God.</p>

          </figure>

<p>Ireland is one of the few Western countries to retain laws of this kind, in this case the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/31">Defamation Act 2009</a>. This no trifling issue in Ireland, the offence attracts a fine of €25,000. </p>

<p>In February, meanwhile, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/denmark-man-burned-quran-koran-video-blasphemy-facebook-islam-prosecuted-charged-46-years-a7594796.html">a man in Denmark was charged with blasphemy</a> for burning a copy of the Koran, a charge not made there for 46 years. Iceland only recently <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33378778">removed the offence</a> from its books in 2015. Nor can we forget, of course, the murder of 12 of the staff of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30708237">French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo</a> by Islamist militants who took offence at the magazine’s lampooning of Islam.</p>



<h2>Free speech on trial</h2>

<p>US academic <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jlr.2013.12">M. Christian Green</a> has asked if there is an “inherent and inevitable conflict” between the right to express one’s religion and the right to criticise it. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0340035215584778">Paul Sturges</a>, meanwhile, has argued that freedom of expression is too valuable to be limited by religious sensitivities.  </p>

<p>Freedom of speech and freedom of religion are hard-fought human rights that appear to be slowly eroding. In 2012, then US president Barack Obama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/obama-un-general-assembly-transcript">told the UN General Assembly</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given the power of faith in our lives and the passion that religious differences can inflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression; it is more speech – the voices of tolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy, and lift up the values of understanding and mutual respect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us hope that a common understanding prevails.</p><img src="https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/78545/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1" />
